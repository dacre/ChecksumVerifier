00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,239
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,632
Hard as you might try, the Republican
Party isn't going anywhere.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,559
You don't know that.
They could all move to Vancouver.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,955
-I don't think so.
-Me neither.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,034
But everybody else can take
a seat for four years.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,837
You have posttraumatic
stress disorder.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,157
Well, that doe'sn't sound Iike
something they'd Iet you have...

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,873
...if you work for the president.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,476
This president was elected
with 48 percent of the vote.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,398
-But he was elected.
-Without a mandate.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,155
The majority of the people voted
for somebody else.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,955
We don't need some kind
of permission for this?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,470
Shouldn't there be
some official supervision?

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,433
We're making a fire in a fireplace.
What supervision do you want?

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,148
FEMA, the American Red Cross?

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,431
-What kind of wood is this?
-I don't know.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,914
-Josh--
-It's freezing in here.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,994
-I acknowledge that it's cold.
-It's Iike Ice Station Zebra.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,919
-It also might bother someone.
-It's half past midnight.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,073
See, here's the thing.
This Iooks Iike spruce to me.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,790
Spruce is softwood.
Softwood burns out quickly.

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,798
-You know what we need?
-A hardwood?

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,354
-That's right.
-Interesting.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,315
-Where did you get the wood?
-It was sitting in the thing.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,314
I think that is meant
to be decorative.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,837
It's wood. We're not burning
Benjamin Harrison's Iog cabin.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,031
-You know what? We might be.
-Why?

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,548
It was made out of spruce.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,432
-Where's C.J.?
-In the Roosevelt Room.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,399
Is she doing the seating chart?

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,875
Jancowitz has a hearing aid
that seldom works.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,038
He needs to be seated near the center.
Would you tell her that?

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,595
You're not using Iighter fluid
or anything, are you?

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,394
No flammable Iiquids of any kind
to start a fire, ever.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,911
-Found it.
-What?

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,674
-Kerosene.
-Josh.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,234
Go.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,029
Speaker.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,988
House majority, House minority.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,914
Senate majority, Senate minority.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,230
-Whip, whip, deputy, deputy.
-Right.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,869
Then the committee chairs.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,270
Ways and Means here.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,471
Finance here.
House Appropriations here.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,159
Senate Appropriations, House Budget.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,789
-Senate Budget.
-Excellent.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,196
-Which brings us to...?
-White House staff.

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,109
-So we've got the chief of staff.
-Next to him the deputy chief of staff.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,831
On the other side of Leo will be
the congressional and political Iiaison.

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,192
Next, the communications director
and deputy communications director.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,391
-Staff aides?
-They'II stand around the wall.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,318
-So we'redone?
-We're set.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,679
-C.J.?
-Don't give me a thing.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,757
Jancowitz has to sit closer
to the center.

55
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,109
-Why?
-He doe'sn't hear well.

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,675
-He can't sit closer.
-His hearing aid malfunctions.

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,669
It's a breakfast to trumpet a new spirit of
bipartisan cooperation in the new year.

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,951
-No one will be Iistening.
-I'm a messenger.

59
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,470
-He's saying don't snub him.
-Because of the thing.

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,072
AII right, ask him if it's better to dis
the House whip or the Senate whip.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,272
You wanna stand them
in a tripod, right?

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,036
Yeah, standing three sticks on end
and slanting them to a common center.

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,912
-Isn't that a tripod?
-But--

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,668
You just thought you'd say more words?

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,796
Josh.

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,718
Hang on. You know what we need?

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,513
-Dried Ieaves?
-We need dried Ieaves.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,995
We gotta move either
the House or the Senate whip.

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,629
-House.
-Why?

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,753
Because Iife is tough.
And if he doe'sn't Iike it, he can kiss me.

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,150
So the spirit of bipartisanship begins?

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,829
Could you possibly get us
some dried Ieaves?

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,989
I'II just run out to the forest
and be right back.

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,829
-You know what?
-You think she was being sarcastic?

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,076
Yeah, I don't think
she's getting the Ieaves.

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,873
-You know what we could use?
-Newspaper.

77
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,476
This is what I'm talking about.
This is teamwork.

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,715
It really is.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,228
-House.
-House?

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,795
So we move the House whip
to the Ieft of Sam...

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,152
...and move Jancowitz across
from Leo, and we're set, right?

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,353
Larry, Ed, we'reset?

83
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,510
Either one of you?
Thank you.

84
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,759
You see? You thought it would take a
Iong time, and it only took 7 1 /2 hours.

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,031
-Somebody working on the heat?
-Seating's set.

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,038
-That took some time.
-It was hard.

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,594
You gotta find a Magic Marker.

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,429
When people sit with the president,
there's excruciating protocol involved.

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,793
-What?
-Missed one.

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,718
-Who?
-Take a Iook.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,753
-I'm Iooking.
-It'II happen.

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,350
Okay, guys? You know what we did?

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,278
-We forgot the president.
-There it is.

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,791
Doe's anybody smell smoke?

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,035
Oh, God.

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,075
I think this might be
because the wood is wet.

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,835
The fire ought to dry it pretty quick,
shouldn't it?

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,030
What did you do?

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,629
-It's going good.
-There's smoke in the hallways.

100
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,195
-What the hell's going on?
-The wood's drying out.

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,472
-Are you burning a dining-room table?
-Spruce is a slow-drying wood.

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,751
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,393
-Hang on.
-Are those instructions?

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,672
It says this fireplace was a "favorite
of President Andrew Johnson"...

105
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,270
...and he would "sip whiskey from a
charcoal keg while reading by its Iight. "

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,709
That doe'sn't help.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,718
The flue's been welded shut
since 1 896.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,797
-That's probably it.
-What are you doing?

109
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,513
Somebody started a fire.

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,836
If the alarms go off,
I gotta wake the president.

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,190
The president's 1000 yards over
and two flights up.

112
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,151
It's procedure.

113
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,189
Well, Iet's get a fire extinguisher
and put it out before the smoke alarm--

114
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,875
-What?
-Mr. President.

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,958
You know how you said not to wake you
unless there was a fire?

116
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,509
-These are the rules.
-They' re the guidelines.

117
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,994
The meeting will Iast 90 minutes.

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,629
-And the rules--
-Guidelines.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,592
We can't talk about
the Patients' Bill of Rights?

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,995
We can talk about it.

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,029
We just can't talk about dropping the
provision that would allow for Iitigation.

122
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,311
-Why not?
-That's not what the breakfast is for.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,068
-What's it for?
-T o symbolize a spirit of cooperation...

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,676
...as the new session begins
and to eat pancakes.

125
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,590
So on the Patients' Bill of Rights,
we'II just debate the things we agree on.

126
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,474
-And minimum wage?
-We won't be talking about that at all.

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,712
No, because it could Iead
to something.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,230
-We can't talk about the Patients' Bill?
-We can.

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,670
Just not about dropping
the no-Iitigation clause.

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,030
Why have rights
if you can't sue for them?

131
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,992
-Fine argument.
-But we won't make it?

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,918
-Not at this breakfast.
-And minimum wage?

133
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,071
Not so much.

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,835
I see we won't be talking
about the 993 tax cut.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,396
We won't be, but we've agreed to call
it tax relief instead of a tax cut.

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,999
We'II call it tax relief?

137
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,153
-But we won't be talking about it.
-Leo, the Patients' Bill of Rights--

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,189
Which we'II call the Comprehensive
Access and Responsibility Act.

139
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,069
What's the Comprehensive Access
and Responsibility Act?

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,758
It's the Patients' Bill of Rights, but
the C.A. R.A. was introduced in 1 999.

141
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,033
It's the same thing. The Republicans
will discuss changing the name back.

142
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,311
In exchange for calling
tax breaks "tax relief"?

143
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,192
-Or income enhancement.
-I'm in a musical.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,591
Getting it renamed is
a hell of a concession.

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,871
-I'm gonna check in with you, okay?
-Sure.

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,948
Sick people who don't get proper medical
care, because they can't afford it...

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,708
...don't care if we've agreed
to change the bill's name.

148
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,359
We agreed to discuss changing it.

149
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,039
-After that?
-Security briefing.

150
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,309
-After that?
-Agriculture.

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,158
Who set off the smoke alarm
Iast night?

152
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,871
It sounds a Iot Iike you' re talking
about Sam, Mr. President.

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,429
Were you inconvenienced?

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,075
They had me on the T ruman Balcony
in my underwear.

155
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,915
-Was it cold?
-In January? No, why do you ask?

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,112
I'd Iike to talk about those rules
in that memo you're reading.

157
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,710
It's a pancake breakfast, Toby.
There's nothing that's important.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,513
We're having Vermont maple syrup?

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,951
If you read item four, you'II see time
at this breakfast will be spent...

160
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,715
...discussing calling
the Patients' Bill of Rights...

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,116
...the Comprehensive Access
and Responsibility Act.

162
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,470
I don't care if it's called
the Monroe Doctrine.

163
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,320
What the hell are we doing
serving Vermont maple syrup?

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,839
On the minimum wage, in item five
of the Rules for Bipartisan Breakfast--

165
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,792
Guidelines.
You keep calling them rules.

166
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,116
Margaret, what doe's it say at the top?

167
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,756
-" Rules for bipartisan breakfast. "
-I keep meaning to fire you.

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,634
New Hampshire syrup is
what we serve in this White House.

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,390
It's a breakfast. We eat. We pose for
pictures, do a postgame conference.

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,359
Everybody gets out,
and I don't have to be Officer Krupke.

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,910
-Anything else?
-An OMB efficiency expert has said...

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,358
...we can free up space by moving
the press room across the street.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,959
What else?

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,954
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,798
Josh.

176
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,110
You feeling all right?

177
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,959
You sure?

178
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,639
You don't mind me asking?

179
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,990
Because I'm gonna ask you
once a day, okay?

180
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,555
You just asked me four times
in the Iast 1 0 seconds.

181
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,990
Go to Ben and Sally's
for dinner tonight.

182
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,952
Are you going?

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,590
Was I invited?

184
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,108
Are Ben and Sally asking for me?

185
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,874
They'd rather you didn't come...

186
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,920
...but they'II do me a favor,
and I need you to do me one too.

187
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,833
What's at Ben and Sally's?

188
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,159
Karen Cahill.

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,269
And what stupid-ass Irish thing
did you say to Karen Cahill...

190
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,912
...that you now need me to apologize
for at Ben and Sally's, Iike a Iittle girl?

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,914
Let me tell you what was surprising
about that moment.

192
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,351
I said that only 1 2 hours
after you were very cool...

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,030
...about my almost accidentally
setting the building on fire.

194
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,472
I made a joke about her shoes.

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,594
I'm sorry?

196
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,318
I made a remark about her shoes.

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,076
-You're the second most powerful man.
-And she writes for The New York Times.

198
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,869
Who knows what relationship
women have with shoes.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,873
What could you possibly have said?

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,438
It was perfectly benign to anyone
who doe'sn't take shoes that seriously.

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,273
Just tell her I Iove her
and that I'm sorry.

202
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,199
-And I'II take her shoe shopping.
-Why don't you tell her?

203
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,116
If someone else tells her, it seems Iike
I was thoughtful enough to mention it.

204
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,272
If I tell her,
it makes me seem feminine.

205
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,228
You don't think the shoe shopping's
gonna take care of that?

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,479
Let's call the insurance company...

207
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,990
...and see how much water damage
is in the Mural Room.

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,474
You needn't wave a stick.

209
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,318
-I am totally there for you.
-Thank you.

210
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,869
-Can I get Sam to do it?
-Fine.

211
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,554
Anything else?

212
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,038
This is about what they say after the
meeting, so Iet's decide what they'II say.

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,231
-It'II be simple enough.
-Like what?

214
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,830
We appreciate the president's invitation
and welcome him to bipartisanship.

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,599
I'II end the press conference.

216
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,030
-You'II welcome him to bipartisanship?
-What's wrong?

217
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,075
I think C.J. is objecting to
the implication that we got there first.

218
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,075
How about we all agree on a need
for a renewed spirit of bipartisanship.

219
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,154
The meeting was positive?
Friendly, frank and productive?

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,029
Our goals can be met
under the president's Ieadership--

221
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,754
-No way.
-What's the problem?

222
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,508
I think what my aide is
objecting to is the implication...

223
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,712
...it's the president's Ieadership
under which our goals will be met.

224
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,429
The meeting was positive, friendly,
frank and productive.

225
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,995
With a spicy bouquet
that suggests a fine merlot.

226
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
Press will be at the northwest entrance.
If we'redone at 1 0:30...

227
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,875
... majority Ieader will speak,
the minority Ieader...

228
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,469
...then C.J. will answer questions
in the briefing room.

229
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,431
If all goes well--

230
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,876
-Why in the briefing room?
-It's where I brief.

231
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,276
The majority Ieader's briefing
first and outside.

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,471
You're doing it Iast,
in back of a podium...

233
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,035
...and in front of a big picture
of the White House.

234
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,909
The majority Ieader will be
in front of the White House.

235
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,468
He'II be on the Capitol steps.

236
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,392
T raditionally, it's in front
of the White House.

237
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,151
T raditionally, the person in my job
has cared what's traditional.

238
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,875
The president won't wanna end
a bipartisan breakfast...

239
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,635
...with Republicans speaking
from one place and Dem--

240
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,469
The majority Ieader won't stand at a
cardboard podium in your front yard...

241
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,036
...while you stand in the White House
briefing room, and with good reason.

242
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,276
-Which is?
-They' re not on equal footing.

243
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,152
Our bosses?
I don't think they are either.

244
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,350
The majority Ieader will brief outside.
If he wants to skip breakfast...

245
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,713
...there'II be more pancakes for us,
and my press room can write about why.

246
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,873
Well, you can't blame a girl
for trying.

247
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,719
-You need me?
-Can I borrow her for a moment?

248
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,274
We'II wait.

249
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,108
-These rules are crap.
-The guidelines?

250
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,672
-We're working with C.J. now.
-I don't care who speaks in what order.

251
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,996
I'm talking about what we say
when we sit down.

252
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,429
-You've got concerns?
-I do.

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,149
Name one.

254
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,592
The president prefers maple syrup
from New Hampshire. I'm not kidding.

255
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,789
We'd better meet on this.

256
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,595
-Breakfast tomorrow?
-What should I wear?

257
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
-I don't give a damn.
-I've heard different.

258
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,679
9:45. So we got that straight.
Where were we?

259
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,236
You were giving me and my staff
an ultimatum.

260
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,954
Did you know there's a pool
under the briefing room?

261
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,708
-I didn't.
-There's a swimming pool under there.

262
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,474
And according to
the OMB efficiency auditor...

263
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,672
...more people work in the West Wing
than in any point in history.

264
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,350
You wanna free up space by kicking out
the press corps and putting in a pool?

265
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,232
I realize there are some flaws
in my Iogic.

266
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,994
-Leo needs a favor.
-What?

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,669
Go to Ben and Sally's
and apologize to Karen Cahill...

268
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,837
-...for making fun of her shoes.
-I didn't.

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,633
-He did.
-I have no problems with them.

270
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,239
-Leo did.
-What was his problem?

271
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,999
-Do what you usually do.
-Here's the thing.

272
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,959
-What?
-I don't do well with Karen.

273
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,668
-Why?
-I get nervous.

274
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,552
-What happens?
-I become unimpressive.

275
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,956
-In what way?
-In many ways.

276
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,874
You don't fall down, do you?

277
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,354
-When?
-With Karen.

278
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,868
-Once.
-You'II be fine.

279
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,559
-You think?
-You'II be impressive.

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,956
I wasn't before.
That doe'sn't mean I won't do it.

281
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,468
-Right.
-You know why?

282
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,954
-Doe'sn't matter.
-Perseverance.

283
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,549
You get back on the horse.

284
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,149
I'II sit there and she'II say,
"Sam Seaborn's impressive.

285
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,870
-I'II say nice things about him. "
-Reach for the stars.

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,394
-I will.
-Good.

287
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,271
I'm having breakfast
with Ann Stark tomorrow.

288
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,915
-Leave it alone.
-We should discuss the minimum wage--

289
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,071
It's a new year!

290
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,993
-Let's not faff around!
-It's breakfast.

291
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,950
I know it's breakfast. We're not gonna
come up with solutions in 90 minutes.

292
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,959
But we have the principals
in a room and no cameras.

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,878
The Ieaders of the Iand.

294
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,073
Not to talk about how we'II approach
minimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights...

295
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,670
...tax relief and education
in the session that's about to begin...

296
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,159
...is a criminally negligent and
cowardly refusal to do what we were...

297
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,919
...all sent here to do.

298
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,156
This is what my ex-wife and I
did for years.

299
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,150
We had these rules.

300
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,877
We could talk about anything but why
we couldn't Iive with each other.

301
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,874
I could have been
two years younger right now.

302
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,675
There was a freshman Democrat
who came to Congress 50 years ago.

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,269
He turned to a senior Democrat
and said:

304
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,869
"Where are the Republicans?
I want to meet the enemy. "

305
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,272
The senior Democrat said,
"The Republicans aren't the enemy.

306
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,916
They're the opposition.
The Senate's the enemy. "

307
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,915
Those days are over.

308
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,470
In this climate--

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,150
This climate is when real debate is
what bipartisanship should Iook Iike.

310
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,676
This woman's had this job two weeks.

311
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,748
I don't Iike dealing with people
who are trying to impress me.

312
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,190
I know her a Iittle.

313
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,714
Have breakfast with her.

314
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,675
Thank you.

315
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,873
Jenny and I wouldn't talk
about it either.

316
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,037
-You know why?
-Why?

317
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,758
Because we Ioved each other,
and it was awful.

318
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,316
And we knew it was
never gonna change.

319
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,919
Ever.

320
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,878
I wanna talk about minimum wage
and Patients' Bill of Rights.

321
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,756
You're talking about the Comprehensive
Access and Responsibility Act there.

322
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,878
-AII right, yeah.
-I brought you a present.

323
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,639
-What is it?
-Guess.

324
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,594
-Really?
-Sure.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,440
-Why?
-I would think it'd be fun.

326
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,874
-You don't think it'd be a waste of time?
-You've Iost your sense of humor.

327
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,754
It's a bottle of New Hampshire
maple syrup.

328
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,076
It's a can of New Hampshire
maple syrup...

329
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,909
...and you just ruined what I think
could've been a nice moment.

330
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,270
-Ann--
-T ax breaks are tax relief now.

331
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,632
And we're changing
South Carolina to Italy.

332
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,918
-The minimum wage.
-You cannot muster a thank you?

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,911
For the syrup?

334
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,755
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

335
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,877
-And congratulations.
-Thank you.

336
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,955
You are the chief of staff to the most
powerful Republican in the country.

337
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,869
-Obviously, a great deal of confidence--
-Where's my present?

338
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,230
For being promoted?

339
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,470
-I don't have one.
-Give me my syrup back.

340
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,229
Are you ready to order?

341
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,718
He's gonna need syrup. I have syrup
here, but he doe'sn't have any.

342
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,149
Scrambled eggs, wheat toast
and coffee, please.

343
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,030
Did the president say the stats were
more staggering in Washington, D. C.?

344
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,630
-Would you remind me to clarify that?
-Why?

345
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,958
He was in Louisville, Kentucky,
when he said it.

346
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,115
-You got my note?
-Moving the press room to the OEOB?

347
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,715
-I did.
-And?

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,595
Don't Iet anyone know you wrote it
and don't ever mention it again.

349
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,871
-Moving the press room?
-See? You mentioned it.

350
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,429
-You did it again.
-I didn't.

351
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,870
-You were about to.
-The OEOB is across the street.

352
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,275
We're not getting a pool.

353
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,870
I know we're not getting a pool,
but we can get needed office space.

354
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,958
We can put distance
between the press and the president...

355
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,152
...and put them across the street
in a state-of-the-art facility.

356
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,079
-By "state-of-the-art" you mean...?
-A room with electricity.

357
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,755
The press doe'sn't want distance
from the president.

358
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,316
And Americans don't want the president
to have distance from the press.

359
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,589
We can't exile the press.

360
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,030
The room is 100 yards
from where we'restanding.

361
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,595
It sends a signal we'retrying
to hide things.

362
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,515
We are, but I don't think we'II be
better at it if they're across the street.

363
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,472
-I'II get more information.
-I don't need it.

364
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,632
-So you can ruminate.
-I don't need to.

365
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,796
Excellent. Josh.

366
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,956
-How'd it go?
-Hang on.

367
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,470
-What do you need?
-Did the monthly DNC go out yet?

368
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,149
-It's going out now.
-Is there time to add a question?

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,110
Donna, get me the polling center
at GIobal Strategies Group.

370
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,828
What's the question?

371
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,795
C.J. thinks if we move the press out
of the West Wing, Americans will object.

372
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,435
-She's crazy.
-So I want to show her numbers.

373
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,870
Mike at GIobal Strategies.

374
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,555
I wanna tack on a question, okay?

375
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,751
Would you object to--?
Would you have--?

376
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,270
Yes or no. Would you have
an objection if--?

377
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,159
What should the question be?

378
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,996
If the White House moved the press
to T renton, would you give a flying--?

379
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,953
Would you object to the White House
moving the press room...

380
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,356
...out of the West Wing
and across the street?

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,993
Read it back.

382
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,918
-How'd it go?
-It went great.

383
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,911
Thank you.

384
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,873
-I had to talk to Karen Cahill Iast night.
-Did you fall down?

385
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,155
I did not.

386
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,637
We were talking about the stability
of former Soviet republics...

387
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,512
...and their fear
of Islamic extremism.

388
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,360
And I have to say, that I made
some very scholarly points...

389
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,229
... regarding the remaining
nuclear weapons in Kirghizstan--

390
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,312
Kazakhstan.

391
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,875
The nuclear weapons are
in Kazakhstan.

392
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,918
I said Kirghizstan?

393
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,671
Well, Kirghizstan has
no nuclear weapons.

394
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,675
Kazakhstan's a country
four times the size of T exas...

395
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,793
...and has a sizable number
of former Russian missile silos.

396
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,471
Kirghizstan's on the side of a hill near
China and has mostly nomads and sheep.

397
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,069
I'm sure you got it right Iast night.

398
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,549
Yes.

399
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,319
I'm sure.

400
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,471
Okay.

401
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,877
It's a photo op, Toby. Let them talk
about the Redskins and their kids.

402
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,952
And why not talk
about the minimum wage?

403
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,352
Because you'II say you want it
raised $2 in 50¢ increments...

404
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,870
...over two years,
and we'II say three years.

405
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,072
Ann, do you know what
a full-time worker...

406
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,670
...employed at $5. 1 5 an hour
makes in a year?

407
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,951
$1 0,71 2.

408
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,636
Which is $2600 below the poverty Iine.
Why have a minimum wage?

409
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,354
-Now you're talking.
-Ann, I--

410
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,110
You think raising the minimum wage
will put a dent in the poverty rate?

411
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,551
I'm saying it could keep up
with inflation.

412
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,515
The Iast 30 years, the purchasing power
of the minimum wage is down 30%.

413
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,718
You know how much
the stock market is up?

414
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,357
A hundred and fifteen percent. Small
businesses will fold or produce Iess...

415
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,677
... because they can't afford
to pay a federally mandated wage.

416
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,112
The unemployed will, in turn, face
higher prices while receiving no wage.

417
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,953
Let's talk about it at breakfast.

418
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,629
-Why?
-Twenty senators will call and say:

419
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,673
"Why are you starting the ball
rolling without us? "

420
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,468
They will say, "Why are you rolling
the ball at all? "

421
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,119
You'II sandbag the thing
in committee.

422
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,751
You've shown us your whole hand.
You're playing a game, and not well.

423
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,916
I just got here.

424
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,353
-Your predecessor didn't play it well.
-That's why they gave me her job.

425
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,355
Ann, we're not gonna get screwed
around on the wage hike.

426
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,831
-We have the votes, and you know it.
-Having the votes doe'sn't matter...

427
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,351
...if the Ieader decides there
isn't gonna be a vote.

428
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,870
There is gonna be a vote,
and if there isn't...

429
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,789
...we'II offer the wage hike as an
amendment on everything that moves.

430
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,350
Say that again.

431
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,990
You heard me the first time.

432
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,236
Do you not remember I'm the same
person who bought you a can of syrup?

433
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,589
What have I done to make you think
I'm scared of you?

434
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,993
-The Patients' Bill of Rights.
-We can talk about it?

435
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,748
We can spend 1 5 minutes
on dropping the Iitigation shield.

436
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,469
-In exchange for what?
-Some flowers.

437
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,876
-In exchange for what?
-The spirit of bipartisanship.

438
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,914
In exchange for what?

439
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,276
I want the press conference
at the Hill.

440
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,712
Our guys are tired of Iooking
Iike the president's stupid cousin.

441
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,672
That's all? You want
the press conference on the Hill?

442
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,870
Done.

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,509
C.J. Cregg says no.

444
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,109
C.J. works for me.

445
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,037
-Thank you for breakfast.
-You're welcome.

446
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,029
-Charlie.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,231
-Who's the next meeting?
-Kim Woo of Singapore.

448
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,159
-You want the cheat sheet?
-I don't need a cheat sheet. Kim Woo:

449
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,870
He won a bronze medal for fencing.
He's a Buddhist.

450
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,755
And he enjoys European history.
You see, even though it's a handshake...

451
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,749
...I make him feel Iike a friend,
and that's what they call people skills.

452
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,314
Kim Woo's a woman, sir.

453
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,876
He's an OIympic athlete.
Don't say that to his face.

454
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,031
-Sir.
-What else?

455
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,473
Sam jotted down some remarks for
your toast at the breakfast tomorrow.

456
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,957
" Ladies and gentlemen. "
That's funny.

457
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,029
-That's funny. She's a woman?
-Yes, sir.

458
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,476
-Did you mark that down?
-Yes, sir.

459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,955
"We spend so much time
demonizing the other side...

460
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,908
...treating our opponents
Iike threatening strangers...

461
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,798
...with whom we share
nothing in common...

462
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,640
...that we've Iost sight, perhaps,
of the greater truths. "

463
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,876
Did you know it's bad Iuck
to toast with water?

464
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,151
-I didn't.
-Yeah, don't toast with water.

465
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,557
-Should we go, sir?
-It's from Greek mythology.

466
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,956
-You Iose your spirit.
-T o what?

467
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,476
T o what do you Iose your spirit?

468
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,150
That's a good question. I could tell you,
but it's better if you Iook it up.

469
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,313
I'II hit the Iibrary as soon
as I get off work tonight at 1 a.m.

470
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,679
"That we've Iost sight, perhaps,
of the greater truths.

471
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,396
There is a Iot more that unites
Americans than divides them. "

472
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,954
That's good.

473
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,152
"There's a Iot more that unites
Americans than divides them. "

474
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,556
-Remind me to tell Sam that's good.
-Yes, sir.

475
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,478
And remind me not
to toast with water.

476
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,428
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

477
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,270
I said the wrong one.

478
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,959
-Maybe not.
-I'm fairly certain.

479
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,276
-You had a 50-50 chance.
-It was Karen Cahill.

480
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,949
I'm sure I said the wrong one.

481
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,356
Why do you guys get worked up
over Karen Cahill?

482
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,153
-She's very influential.
-So are you.

483
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,915
-She's a columnist.
-You talk to Iots of columnists.

484
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,038
-She has special powers.
-You think?

485
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,311
-Maybe you didn't get it wrong.
-I got it wrong.

486
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,115
-Maybe there are nuclear weapons there.
-There are barely pots and pans there.

487
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,999
-You think The Times will tease you?
-I do.

488
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,879
You gotta be used to that by now.

489
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,549
-Yeah, here's what we'II do.
-We're gonna do something?

490
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,034
-You talk to her.
-I don't know her.

491
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,873
-You met her.
-We've been introduced.

492
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,635
-You said you two made a connection.
-That's true.

493
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,150
-Here's what you do.
-I connect with people.

494
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,032
You're going to the South Street exhibit?

495
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,431
-How did you know?
-You told me. She's going.

496
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,948
-How do you know?
-She told me.

497
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,835
-A Iot of reconnaissance went into this.
-You're gonna go up to her:

498
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,873
"Hi, I'm Donna Moss.
I'm Josh Lyman's assistant. "

499
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,628
You had to come up to her.
She'd get a kick out of this.

500
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,154
Sam Seaborn's being so cute.

501
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,232
He thinks he may have said
Kirghizstan...

502
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,869
...when he meant Kazakhstan.

503
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,354
"Sam Seaborn's being so cute"?

504
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,868
-It would kill you?
-No.

505
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,037
Thank you.

506
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,115
Listen, I just had breakfast
with Ann Stark.

507
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,831
-Minimum wage?
-No.

508
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,589
-It's for the best.
-Why?

509
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,995
-There will be a fight.
-Yes.

510
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,599
-Toby.
-There should be a fight.

511
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,313
We disagree on something important.

512
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,313
Which means there should
be a compromise.

513
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,076
-It won't happen posing for a picture.
-It won't happen eating pancakes either.

514
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,075
Let them tell dirty jokes for 90 minutes,
shake hands and start the year.

515
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,993
Not when it's the taxpayers' pancakes.

516
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,109
T axpayers will be happy the Democrats
are trying to tighten their belts.

517
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,395
They'II put a provision
of the Patient's Bill for discussion.

518
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,153
That's something you can disagree on.

519
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,234
-Fifteen minutes.
-You can shout a Iot in 1 5 minutes.

520
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,432
In exchange, she wants
the press conference on the Hill.

521
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,153
She wants the whole thing on the Hill?

522
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,995
-Yeah, Iisten--
-I said no to the split conference.

523
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,750
-What makes her think I'II put--?
-Because I'm asking you to.

524
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,678
What?

525
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,951
-That's what they get in exchange--
-You kidding?

526
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,468
-Look--
-Are you kidding me?

527
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,149
-Who cares where the--?
-I don't even know where to start!

528
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,868
-C.J.--
-But first of all...

529
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,879
...if they need a response,
I need 20 minutes with staff.

530
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,038
I can't huddle in front of the White
House and congressional press corps.

531
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,634
There won't be a surprise.

532
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,673
You've decided what to say,
which is not much of anything.

533
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,951
We don't speak for the president
at the Capitol.

534
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,673
We don't need their microphone.

535
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,350
It makes us Iook Iike Iess than what we
are. In fact, it makes us Iook small.

536
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,039
We call tax breaks "tax reliefs"...

537
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,670
...refuse to discuss raising the salary
of those Iiving in poverty...

538
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,279
...arguing about seating...

539
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,471
...and you think that'II
make us Iook small?

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,149
We're talking about the no-Iitigation
clause for 1 5 minutes.

541
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,030
I don't care if the damn press
conference is outside the Rotary CIub.

542
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,479
It shouldn't be me, then.
It should be Henry.

543
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,279
Fine.

544
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,073
It should be the deputy.

545
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,432
-I'II tell Ann it's not gonna be you.
-I think this is a bad idea.

546
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,269
First visual is that Congress is the seat
of power and the president's irrelevant.

547
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,753
Not only that, but you just took
my Iegs out from under me with Ann.

548
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,873
Are you ordering me to move it
to the Hill?

549
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,232
-I don't Iike doing that.
-You're gonna have to.

550
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,432
Do it.

551
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,073
-It's about to start.
-C.J.

552
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,959
Steve, you should be on the Hill.

553
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,275
I'm gonna watch it on TV.

554
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,154
Are you thinking about moving
the press room across the street?

555
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,959
-No.
-I heard you were discussing it.

556
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,555
-From who?
-Chris.

557
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,875
It's starting.

558
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,435
-She was sure you were discussing it.
-Why?

559
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,676
She got called by a pollster,
who asked her how she felt--

560
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,353
She got called by a pollster?

561
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,676
-She herself got called?
-It's starting.

562
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,678
-Anyway--
-Let me get into it.

563
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,757
Thanks.

564
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,671
Good morning. We 're joined today
with Congressman Dade...

565
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,838
... Congressman Shallick, Senator
Hammond and then Senator Ford.

566
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,590
Unfortunately, the majority leader has
a sore throat and is unable to join us.

567
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,673
He 's gone back to his office.

568
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,871
We concluded a frank
and productive meeting--

569
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,151
-When did he get a sore throat?
-I don't--

570
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,637
She took the majority Ieader
off the board.

571
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,509
--bipartisanship, as we face the
coming Iegislative session.

572
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,798
We'II answer questions
for a few moments this morning. Yes.

573
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,270
Was the Patients' Bill of Rights
discussed?

574
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,036
The Comprehensive Access and
Responsibility Act, it was discussed...

575
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,870
-... though I hesitate to comment--
-She took him off the board.

576
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,879
Was it a balance thing?
No, she didn't want balance.

577
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,559
-She wanted power.
-Maybe--

578
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,353
Why did she take her boss
off the board?

579
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,879
We discussed the litigation clause, but
I don 't wanna get into the specifics.

580
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,878
-We're about to get hit.
-What about the minimum wage hike?

581
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,513
The wage hike was not discussed.

582
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,872
Well, are you considering
a $2 increase over two years?

583
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,873
We want the same thing
over three years.

584
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,952
Certainly the leader's position 's--

585
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,395
Call on Simon.

586
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,755
We didn't discuss it. Craig?

587
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,195
Call on Simon.

588
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,876
Is it fair to say it's the majority Ieader
holding this up and not the majority?

589
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,999
I don't think it's fair to say either.
In the back. Simon.

590
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,675
Congressman, I'm quoting
a senior White House aide...

591
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,598
...who says they have the votes.

592
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,952
The aide said unless they get a straight
up or down vote from the Ieader--

593
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,433
This is the quote, "We'II attach it as an
amendment to everything that moves. "

594
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,435
-Could you say that again?
- The senior aide said--

595
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,994
I don 't wanna comment on this.

596
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,756
I think I'd like to get back to
the breakfast meeting and then for--

597
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,954
Excuse me, but I'm sorry.

598
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,708
My friend from Michigan is too polite
to comment on this.

599
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,276
I'm not burdened
by any such sense of etiquette.

600
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,869
-Congressman.
- This is disgraceful.

601
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,073
The record should show a spitball
contest was begun behind our backs...

602
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,793
... through the press...

603
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,715
...and before the 107th Congress
was even gaveled into session.

604
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,357
You want some quotes?
Open your note pads.

605
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,670
It's Toby.

606
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,555
It is sadly not atypical of this
White House to make a public show--

607
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,229
-I'm the senior aide.
-No kidding. Get me Henry.

608
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,315
We came here in an honest effort--

609
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,550
Henry.

610
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,952
I've got Henry. What do you want?

611
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,429
If the White House says
one thing to our face...

612
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,671
...and another to us
through the media...

613
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,669
...if the White House ambushes us
with ultimatums in the press--

614
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,831
What do you want me to do, Toby?

615
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,951
Don't Iet him take the podium.

616
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,390
He'II take questions
in the briefing room in 20 minutes.

617
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,270
Henry, get home.

618
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,992
Congressman, one last question!

619
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,872
Doe's the White House
really have the vote?

620
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,873
What the hell happened?

621
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,116
That was me.

622
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,995
I gave Ann Stark the quote,
and she fed it to a reporter.

623
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,158
-Why'd you give her the quote?
-It wasn't a quote.

624
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,631
-What was it?
-I told her we had the votes--

625
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,069
She knows we have the votes.

626
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,749
She was promoted to chief of staff
for the Senate majority Ieader.

627
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,838
You don't think she knows
we have the votes?

628
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,079
I misunderstood our relationship.

629
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Now it Iooks Iike we went to the press
and went for his knees.

630
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,512
Excuse me, but Toby's not the one
who gave it to the press.

631
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,632
Will the majority Ieader believe that?

632
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,598
-No.
-It was a breakfast.

633
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,872
It was a damn photo opportunity.

634
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,352
The year is one week old.
The Iegislative session hasn't begun.

635
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,873
We can't put a forkful of waffles in our
mouth without coughing up the ball.

636
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,071
You got beat.

637
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,316
Yes.

638
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,109
I have press in 1 0 minutes.

639
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,637
Figure it out.
T ell me what you're gonna do.

640
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,229
We can take the highroad...

641
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,875
...say we don't want it to disintegrate
into a war of words.

642
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,832
We don't wanna disrupt
a fragile peace.

643
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,874
It's been disrupted. We're accused
of ambushing the majority Ieader.

644
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,754
Labor's gonna want to know
we stand by the minimum wage.

645
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,554
Why don't we have
the Labor secretary make a statement?

646
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,479
-We support the $2 minimum wage.
-Let's emphasize how close we are.

647
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,269
We support the $2 minimum-wage
hike spread over two years.

648
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,551
The Republicans want it over
three years. We're close.

649
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,956
It sounds Iike we're close to agreeing
on 30 months, which we're not.

650
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,832
No one will cover a statement
from a Labor secretary...

651
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,838
...which is good because it'd Iook
Iike we were ducking.

652
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,076
-No, I don't think--
-She's right.

653
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,638
We can't be passive, and the highroad
doe'sn't go where we need it to.

654
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,356
Be cool. Be funny.
Smack them down hard.

655
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,677
The majority Ieader is out of touch
with the needs of real people.

656
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,030
Why wasn't he at the podium?
A sore throat?

657
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,757
We know how tough that is. Thank
goodness he had health insurance.

658
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,189
-There it is.
-That's the sound bite.

659
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,555
And that's the new story.

660
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,152
-Toby?
-Do it.

661
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,232
Carol, I need voting stats
on health care.

662
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,836
Five minutes.

663
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,473
How's this for a phrase?

664
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,758
You can Iay down in front of the train,
or you can get onboard.

665
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,678
That's a really bad phrase.

666
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,669
Is it better if it's, "You can get onboard
the train or Iay down in front of it"?

667
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,473
No, it's really bad either way.

668
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,193
Josh, this was delivered by messenger.

669
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,351
What is it?

670
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,798
It's-- Wait, wait. No, damn,
my x-ray vision is failing me today.

671
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,559
Give me that.

672
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,875
-How'd it go?
-Last night?

673
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,349
Did you talk to her?

674
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,989
I explained you said Kirghizstan
when you meant Kazakhstan.

675
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,879
Did you say it was cute
how I worried?

676
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,879
-I did.
-Did I get it wrong?

677
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,357
-She said she wasn't really Iistening.
-Okay.

678
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,679
I had a most stimulating conversation
with her. It was pithy. It was erudite.

679
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,269
And most of all, it required
no follow-up explanation.

680
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,879
-Donna?
-What was in the envelope?

681
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,159
Your underwear.

682
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,391
What?

683
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,156
I'm holding your underwear
in my hand right now.

684
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,398
And the way I know
it's your underwear...

685
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,313
...is, your name is sewn in the back...

686
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,951
...which, obviously, we'II spend some
time talking about at a Iater date.

687
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,355
How did you get my underwear?

688
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,313
Did you wear the same pair of pants
two days in a row this week?

689
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,428
-No.
-Donna?

690
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,073
-Yes.
-Okay...

691
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,551
...when you got dressed on day two...

692
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,876
...did you check the pant Ieg
for the previous day's underwear?

693
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,920
-I don't need to check the pant Ieg--
-Donna.

694
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,599
-They fell out of my pants?
-It would appear that way.

695
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,873
Where?

696
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,559
The South Street exhibit.

697
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,116
-Where?
-On the floor, in front of Karen Cahill.

698
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,756
-T ell me she's not the one--
-She sent a note.

699
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,951
Fred and Ethel, would you follow
me, please?

700
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,834
I think she's talking about us.

701
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,549
Did a question get tacked on to
the monthly DNC tracking poll...

702
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,353
-...about moving the press room?
-Yes...

703
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,115
... because I wanted to shoot down
the argument the public--

704
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,755
The public gets news from the press,
and the press gets news--

705
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,871
It's a private poll. The press doe'sn't
have access to it.

706
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,149
They don't know what questions
we'reasking?

707
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,191
Are you sure?

708
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,079
The only way they'd know what
questions were asked...

709
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,518
...is if they were called by one
of the pollsters and-- Oh, my God!

710
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,950
-Yes.
-A reporter got called by a pollster?

711
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,468
Yes, indeed. Yes.

712
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,876
-What are the chances of that?
-They' re astronomical.

713
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,476
-Guys.
-They sample 800 respondents.

714
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,758
Would the two of you stop being
amazed by the mathematics?

715
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,553
AII right, I'd pass it off.

716
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,877
Say some schnook in the management
office wanted to kick it around.

717
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,316
Sam?

718
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,958
It's gonna be me, right?

719
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,355
-Okay.
-You ready?

720
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,994
You had a Iot of opportunities today
to say I told you so...

721
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,913
...and score some points with Leo.

722
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,071
You're a class act.

723
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,836
Why were you holding
women's underwear before?

724
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,715
Never really needed a reason.
Heat them up.

725
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,669
C.J.

726
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,552
C.J.

727
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,432
White House press secretary
C.J. Cregg...

728
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,071
... characterized the Republican
response as bizarre.

729
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,874
There was no intent to ambush
the Republican Party with an issue...

730
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,032
... that's been on the table
for a year.

731
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,949
Ann Stark, recently installed chief of
staff in the majority leader's office...

732
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,953
... said she was surprised
by the White House--

733
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,839
And shocked.

734
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,590
Shocked to discover there's gambling
going on in this establishment.

735
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,873
Maybe if you'd gotten me a gift
of some kind.

736
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,559
You think this is funny?

737
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,998
You used to have a sense
of humor, Toby.

738
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,590
-You never had a sense of humor.
-Ann--

739
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,836
I think you'II have to get next
to the idea...

740
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,078
-...your party isn't in the majority.
-My party's in the White House.

741
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,713
A building to which the Constitution
doe's not endow sovereign power.

742
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,953
You think I'II sit around while you
reduce the president to prime minister?

743
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,677
Stand or sit. We're in the majority,
and things are gonna have to Iook it.

744
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,953
And by the way, don't ever walk
into my office without an appointment.

745
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,629
You'd think this could wait
until an election year.

746
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,071
-When is it not an election year?
-T en years ago, we'd sit down.

747
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,672
We'd order a couple of bourbons.
We'd talk about health care.

748
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,635
We'd talk about the minimum wage.

749
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,875
He didn't have a sore throat.

750
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,788
No.

751
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,954
You kept him off the board
so he could come back on and fix it.

752
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,758
-When will you announce?
-Announce what?

753
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,951
That he's running for president.

754
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,515
I'm pretty sure we just did.

755
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,356
I'm gonna read a short statement in
response to the rather bizarre take on--

756
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,910
I think the whole damn thing is bizarre.

757
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,838
I don't know if this is
the right moment--

758
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,310
-Right moment for what?
-Donna Moss needs a favor.

759
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,831
While talking to Karen Cahill, she
accidentally dropped her underwear.

760
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,395
She feels Karen Cahill may have
misinterpreted that.

761
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,474
Donna asked me to ask you
if you'd call Karen Cahill...

762
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,116
...and make it clear she wasn't
making a sexual advance.

763
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,879
I'm not sure there is a right moment
to ask me that, Charlie.

764
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,798
So I should tell her no.

765
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,152
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Donna wants me to call Karen Cahill...

766
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,512
...and say she wasn't hitting on her
when she gave her her underwear.

767
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,353
That's because I made fun
of her shoes...

768
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,796
.. Sam said there were
nuclear weapons in Kirghizstan...

769
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,152
...and Donna went to clear it up
and accidentally Ieft her underwear.

770
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,074
There can't possibly be
nuclear weapons in Kirghizstan.

771
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,233
Mr. President, please don't wade
hip-deep into this story.

772
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,391
Sir?

773
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,036
Toby.

774
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,669
I'm going to bed. If anybody thinks
of new ways for us to make friends...

775
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,838
...don't hesitate to wake me,
or just feel free to start a fire.

776
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,232
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Good night.

777
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,512
Toby.

778
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,279
He didn't wanna see me.

779
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,911
He'II be all right in the morning.

780
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,830
You're the communications director.
It was a TV show.

781
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,877
It was a blunder from top to bottom.

782
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,275
You should know that it could've
been avoided if I'd Iistened to C.J.

783
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,549
Or me.

784
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,476
AIexander Hamilton didn't think
we should have political parties.

785
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,673
Neither did John Adams. They thought
political parties Ied to divisiveness.

786
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,269
They do. They should.

787
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,152
We have disagreements.
Arguments are good.

788
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,916
Only if they Iead to statesmanship.

789
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,030
Or it's just theater.

790
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,274
And statesmanship is compromise.

791
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,910
What about persuasion?

792
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,920
They' re coming for us, Leo.

793
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,195
I know.

794
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,678
I mean, they' re coming for us now.

795
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,077
Toby, if you knew what it was Iike
getting him to run the first time....

796
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,558
-I know.
-Like pushing molasses up a sandy hill.

797
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,150
If I go and tell him it's time to run
again, he's gonna get crazy...

798
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,673
...and frustrated.
He's gonna sink into his head.

799
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,632
And he's gonna say he's not running.

800
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,908
So we've gotta do it for him.

801
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,108
We'II keep it away from this office...

802
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,320
...but we've gotta get real now.

803
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,072
Ann Stark's a wartime consigliere.
That's why she was bumped up.

804
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,272
I'm a wartime consigliere too, Toby.

805
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,033
I was just hoping it'd be peacetime
a Iittle Ionger.

806
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,872
Son of a bitch.

807
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,033
Shake my hand.

808
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,276
-We just formed it.
-Formed what?

809
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,711
The Committee to Re-elect
the President.
