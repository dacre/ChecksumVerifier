00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,471
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,836
-Can I ask?
-Am I a hooker?

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
-Which kid is Leo McGarry's daughter?
-That would be me.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,031
You told our boss's daughter
you slept with a call girl?

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,278
She was putting herself through school
under Iess-than-good circumstances.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,231
Way to go, Laurie.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,549
It took three hours to confirm
there was a picture.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,876
-You've got an itch for Sam Seaborn.
-I do not.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,873
-A Iittle itch.
-You're asking me out.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,033
There will be under no circumstances
sex at the end of the evening.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,750
-There's a concern.
-C.J. doe'sn't know anything.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,157
Excuse me, I need to go
Iook Iike an idiot.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,988
-Galileo 5.
-Yes, sir.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,395
-Just the name.
-Galileo 5.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,113
-You can feel the adventure.
-Indeed.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,637
NASA's great at naming things.
Mercury. Apollo. Atlantis.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,229
-Sea of T ranquility. Ocean of Storms.
-Good names.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,432
First time I heard Galileo 5,
the way the imagination immediately--

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,950
It reminded me of the way
folks in my generation felt...

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,679
...when we heard "Yellow Submarine. "

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,712
We really did wanna Iive
in a yellow submarine.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,797
I can't believe they gave you
driver's Iicenses.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,593
-Where are we going?
-Mars briefing rehearsal.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,835
-Why?
-T o rehearse.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,235
-Say the name.
-I said it.

26
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,750
Say it again. Your imagination,
Iike a child...

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,072
...will explode with unrestrained
possibilities for adventure.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,033
-Galileo 5.
-You didn't say it right.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,799
-I said it fine.
-Say it again.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,750
-Who wrote this intro?
-I did.

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,508
You from NASA Public Affairs?
You mind if I give it a polish?

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,432
-Is there a problem?
-Mind if I change it?

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,388
I'd prefer you didn't.
Public Affairs cleared the text.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,031
-I'd prefer if the president change it.
-That's kind of what he pays me to do.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,596
Look, I don't wanna step on your toes.
We're both writers.

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,553
I suppose, if we broaden the definition
to those who can spell.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,029
Excuse me?

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,799
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,719
-They' re from NASA Public Affairs.
-How you doing?

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,275
We're gonna run through the drill
for tomorrow morning.

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,872
First of all, you'II be flanked by FIight
Operations Manager David Narakawa...

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,879
...and NASA Chief Administrator
Dr. Peter Jobson.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,435
On either side of them
will be Dr. Samuel Thurman...

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,029
...of the Meteorite Analysis T eam
from the Johnson Space Center...

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,876
...and Dr. Joyce-Grey Sutton, planetary
geologist from Cal State Northridge.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,436
On these monitors you'II see the images
beamed back from the surface...

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,952
...and on this computer screen you'II
be able to read the kids' questions.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,910
-I strongly urge you--
-Yes, I know.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,509
I strongly urge you
to act as moderator...

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,075
...and pass questions off
to the experts on the panel...

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,039
-... rather than answer it yourself.
-Yes.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,875
-Would you Iike to see the questions?
-We have the questions?

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,874
-Some. Would you put them up?
-Sure.

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
Katie, a sixth-grader
at Green Oaks Junior High School...

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,315
...Austin, T exas,
asks " How old is the planet Mars? "

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,513
That's a great question, Katie.
The planet Mars is 4. 6 billion years old.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,393
-What did I say?
-I knew that one.

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,875
-Nobody Iikes a know-it-all.
-Yes, God forbid...

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,273
...that while talking to 60,000 students,
the president should appear smart.

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,028
-That's fine. Just don't show off.
-I don't show off.

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,595
Stevie, fourth-grader, P S. 31,
Manhattan, asks:

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,075
"What is the temperature on Mars? "

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,869
Stevie, if one of our expert panelists
were here...

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,472
...they would tell you the temperature
ranges from 1 5 degrees to minus 1 40.

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,992
That happens to be wrong.
It ranges from 60 to minus 225.

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,033
I converted it to Celsius in my head.

67
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,991
Thank you.

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,471
-Can I see the intro?
-It's up on the prompter.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,389
"Good morning. I'm speaking to you Iive
from the west wing of the White House.

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,997
T oday, we have a very unique
opportunity to take part Iive...

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,431
...in an extremely historic event
which-- Whoa, boy.

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,631
-How you doing?
-Who wrote this intro?

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,957
I did, sir. I'm Scott T ate
from NASA Public Affairs.

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,437
Scott, unique means "one of a kind. "
Something can't be very unique.

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,312
Nor can it be extremely historic.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,439
Do we have to use "Iive"
twice in the first two sentences...

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,310
...Iike we just cracked the technology?
We're also broadcasting in color, right?

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,874
-Sam?
-Yeah.

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,995
-He's gonna make changes.
-You gonna clear them with me?

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,708
I doubt it.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,754
Write this: "Good morning, 1 1 months
ago, a 1 200-pound spacecraft...

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,316
...blasted off from Cape Canaveral,
FIorida. Eighteen hours ago--"

83
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,113
-Is it 1 8 hours ago?
-Yeah.

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,956
"Eighteen hours ago,
it Ianded on the planet Mars.

85
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,115
You, me and 60,000 of your fellow
students across the country...

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,955
...along with astro-scientists
and engineers...

87
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,476
...from the Jet Propulsion Lab
in California...

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,634
... NASA Houston, and right here
at the White House...

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,070
...are gonna be the first
to see what it sees...

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,432
...and to chronicle the extraordinary
voyage of an unmanned ship...

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,869
...called Galileo 5.

92
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,073
He said it right.

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,915
I don't understand how if it's noon
in the East and 9:00 Pacific...

94
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,872
... how it's 2:37 on Mars.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,952
Well, Mars is a different time zone.

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,276
Yeah, it's the 37 minutes I was--

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,597
Mars rotates on its own axis once
every 24 hours and 37 minutes.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,909
Have you seen this morning's
news report?

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,589
-About the green beans?
-I didn't see anything about that.

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,030
The Milwaukee Journal
is quoting an unnamed source...

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,510
...as saying the president
doe'sn't Iike green beans.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,358
That's a pretty slow news day
in Milwaukee.

103
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,398
-Josh.
-It's not gonna be a thing.

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,996
You guys done?
Walk me out.

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,756
-Ask me how Iong a Martian day is.
-No, I don't think I will.

106
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,678
Toby, do you know how
a stamp is chosen?

107
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,836
-A stamp?
-Yeah.

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,996
-You'II Iearn.
-Why?

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,271
-The postmaster general needs your help.
-Why?

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,670
The Citizens' Stamp
Advisory Committee--

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,349
There's a Citizens' Stamp
Advisory Committee?

112
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,552
Made up of members of the "There
But for the Grace of God Go I " club.

113
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,910
You wanna mock people
or Iet me talk to Toby?

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,235
I wanna mock people.

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,034
The Citizens' Stamp Advisory
Committee has recommended...

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,955
...to the postmaster that Marcus
Aquino be put on the next issue.

117
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,468
-You know who he is?
-No.

118
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,957
He's a former resident commissioner
of Puerto Rico and a Korean War hero.

119
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,954
-What's the problem?
-He advocated statehood, right?

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,310
-Strongly advocated it.
-Give it to somebody else.

121
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,510
-No.
-PIease?

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,758
This is a public face thing.
The postmaster general wants your help.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,076
Well, he can wait in a Iine
around the block...

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,516
...while two of my 20 teller windows
are open.

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,268
Make a recommendation
by the end of the day.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,232
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing. I just....

127
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,877
Toby got the stamp assignment.

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,991
-Leo, I might need some help.
-Take Josh.

129
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,955
Thanks. Congratulations.
You're choosing the next stamp.

130
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,231
Wow, that happened fast.

131
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,352
-687 days?
-Yeah.

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,829
-Hey, Carol.
-Hey, Toby.

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,997
A Martian year is 687 days.

134
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,952
Yes. Did you see this
morning's news report?

135
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,953
-I'm boning up my Mars.
-C.J.?

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,310
He thinks he's so smart,
just because he's so smart.

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,875
-Did you see this morning's--?
-I highlighted your copy.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,997
You didn't highlight
the green beans story.

139
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,510
I thought it best
to alert the Justice Department.

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,758
-"An unnamed White House source. "
-I read the story. I didn't highlight it.

141
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,911
You don't think this'II get picked up?
Why not?

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,191
-It's not a story.
-See me in three hours.

143
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,879
-It's not a story.
-See me in three hours.

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,352
-How many moons doe's Mars have?
-Two. Phobos and Deimos.

145
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,119
-Get out.
-Three hours.

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,271
-Carol?
-Yeah?

147
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,113
She wants information
on green beans.

148
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,953
-You have work?
-I'm picking a stamp.

149
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,673
Nobody Iikes people
who know everything.

150
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,918
-So I've discovered in my Iife.
-Get me information on green beans.

151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,794
The afternoon is blocked off
for budget meetings. 3:00, HUD.

152
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,470
3:30, Health and Human Services.
4, Interior, and 4:30, Agriculture.

153
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,830
-Good afternoon, Mr. President.
-Yeah. What else?

154
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,874
5:00 is a reception for the UAW. You've
got phone calls from 5:30 to 6:30.

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,550
Okay, but then, Iet's bring the curtain
down. I've got a great night planned.

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,434
I've got two books on Mars
and a book on Galileo himself.

157
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,434
I'm gonna go to the residence
and read. Mrs. Landingham.

158
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,233
-Yes, sir?
-Nothing after 6:30.

159
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,233
I'm gonna go read about Mars...

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,314
...which, while colder and drier,
has four Earth-Iike seasons.

161
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,153
No, sir.

162
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,039
-It doe's.
-I'm sure you're right.

163
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,992
I'm saying, no, you won't
be reading tonight.

164
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,948
-You're attending a concert.
-Since when?

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,719
Mr. McGarry's office
put it on your schedule.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
-Get me Leo.
-I was about to tell you.

167
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,512
-It's important that you go.
-T o a concert?

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,594
-Did Buddy Holly come back?
-It's the Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,235
The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra?
Leo?!

170
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,790
-It's in Iceland.
-I know where Reykjavik is.

171
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,230
-I wish I was there right now.
-Yes, Mr. President?

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,988
-The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra?
-I hear they' re pretty good.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,710
-Why do I--?
-You canceled yesterday's meeting...

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,911
-...with the Icelandic ambassador.
-I'm being punished?

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
No. Iceland is considering
defying the ban on whale hunting...

176
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,310
...imposed by the International
Whaling Commission.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,909
They're in danger of joining
Norway and Japan.

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,029
There's a Iucrative international demand
for fresh Icelandic minke whale meat.

179
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,514
-Is this a joke?
-No, sir.

180
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,917
The State Department
and the Fisheries subdivision...

181
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,909
...of the Department of Agriculture feel
we should avoid offending Iceland.

182
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,668
-Which we did by canceling the meeting.
-Apparently.

183
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,798
So to make up for it, I'm going
to see the Reykjavik Symphony.

184
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,718
-Yes, sir.
-With Ambassador...?

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,991
Vigdis OIafsdottir.

186
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,316
-Okay.
-He's very excited to meet you.

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,989
I'II give you $1000
if you don't make me go.

188
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,073
-Think of the whales.
-Do they vote?

189
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,959
Mr. President?
Intelligence briefing.

190
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,998
-Send them in.
-This might be something.

191
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,474
-Why?
-There was an explosion...

192
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,796
...in a Russian oil refinery.

193
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,959
-Good afternoon.
-Hey, Jack.

194
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,719
-Charlie?
-Yes, sir.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,592
Gentlemen, please.

196
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,990
-There was an explosion?
-IT AR-T ASS is reporting...

197
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,874
...that there's a fire burning
in an oil refinery in Kozelsk.

198
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,873
-It's in the oblast region?
-Yeah.

199
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,516
-What's the problem, Jack?
-There is no oil refinery in Kozelsk.

200
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,790
Oh, man.

201
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,674
The closest oil refinery
is about 20 kilometers southeast.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,036
It's not a refinery fire?

203
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,836
-It's a missile silo.
-There was an explosion in a missile silo?

204
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,957
We can't confirm that at this point...

205
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,510
... but the Russians
have 20 SS-1 9's in the quadrant.

206
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,711
Keyhole has pictures
of a column of smoke...

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,798
...emergency personnel on the ground,
but no burning structure.

208
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,957
Certainly no oil refinery.

209
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,992
If a missile exploded,
is it possible it was armed?

210
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,270
Was there a warhead?

211
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,876
-We can have a briefing in an hour.
-Half-hour, Jack.

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,631
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,194
Did they think
we weren't gonna see it, Leo?

214
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,955
It's a Cold War mentality.

215
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,515
If they ask, we could help.

216
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,275
I wouldn't wait for the phone to ring.

217
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,913
Yeah.

218
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,909
Yeah.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,036
Galileo Galilei.

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,908
He sat in a cathedral in Pisa.

221
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,236
He watched a Iamp suspended
from the ceiling...

222
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,476
...as it oscillated back and forth.

223
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,034
He used his pulse to keep time...

224
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,795
...and discovered
that the period of oscillation...

225
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,071
...was independent
of the size of the arc.

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,351
Years Iater,
he contradicted the theory...

227
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,031
...that a heavier body falls
faster than a Iighter one...

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,629
...which took some guts
back in 1 609...

229
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,675
...when you consider that the theory
he was contradicting was Aristotle's.

230
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,033
You want a broader theme
for the classroom?

231
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,036
Charlie? I really do.
Have Sam and C.J. come tonight.

232
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,873
-I'II be in my office.
-Thanks.

233
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,958
-Yes, sir.
-He contradicted Aristotle, Charlie.

234
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,914
-He saw the rings on Saturn?
-Yes, he did.

235
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,836
-Did you need something, sir?
-Yes. What's next?

236
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,680
Deputy Secretary Hallis
and the T rap Commission.

237
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,871
They' re meeting in the Map Room....

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,799
The process by which a postage stamp
enters into circulation...

239
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,469
-... begins with the American public.
-What?

240
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,954
-Are you even Iistening?
-No.

241
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,634
-Do you wanna do this?
-I don't.

242
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,114
-I did index cards.
-How many?

243
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,879
-Eighty-seven.
-Reduce it to three.

244
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,476
-Philately's fun, Josh.
-I'm sorry, what's fun?

245
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,036
-Philately. Stamp collecting.
-Be careful how you say that word--

246
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,880
-Can I work?
-T ell me what you know.

247
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,550
The process by which a stamp enters
into circulation begins with the public.

248
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,068
That's always our first mistake.

249
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,597
Proposals are submitted to the
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee...

250
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,518
-...the acronym for which is--
-Dork Squad.

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,355
C-SAC. The committee
then makes a recommendation...

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,915
...to the postmaster general,
in this case, Marcus Aquino.

253
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,356
He won the Silver Star
for service in Korea.

254
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,956
There are numerous instances of valor
and actions above and beyond the call.

255
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,919
As Puerto Rico's
resident commissioner...

256
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,516
... he served Congress
faithfully and well.

257
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,234
-Let's put him on a stamp.
-Let's put you on a stamp.

258
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,550
-Okay.
-Let's talk about the problem.

259
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,793
Toby.

260
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,749
-Two hours and 20 minutes.
-Yes. Let me say first...

261
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,838
-...you were right and I was wrong.
-The oddsmakers take a beating.

262
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,159
When I said nobody would pick it up?
Everybody's picked it up.

263
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,034
And when I said even if they did,
it wouldn't be a big deal?

264
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,753
It's a bit of a deal. Know where?

265
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,678
-In Oregon?
-In Oregon. You know why?

266
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,598
They're a major producer
of green beans?

267
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,518
They're a huge producer, Toby.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,549
Green beans, or snap beans,
represent a significant percentage...

269
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,269
...of Oregon's annual revenue.
But here's the thing.

270
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,035
-There's an electoral problem?
-There's an electoral problem.

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,948
We won Oregon by Iess than 1 0,000
votes and we'II need them.

272
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,198
-Yeah.
-Okay. Well, I'm on it now.

273
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,874
-Good.
-So-- You know what?

274
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,796
So it took me Ionger to figure it out.
Doe'sn't make you smarter than I am.

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,718
-Of course not.
-Thank you.

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,276
-My SAT scores, on the other hand--
-I've gotta spin the green bean problem.

277
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,039
Knock 'em dead.

278
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,912
-Oh, C.J.
-I had fine SAT scores.

279
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,316
The president wants you
to go with him tonight.

280
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,751
He wants to discuss a theme for
the closed-circuit classroom tomorrow.

281
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,349
A theme?
We're Ianding a probe on Mars.

282
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,915
-That's the theme.
-He wants to discuss a broader theme.

283
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,554
-He wants Sam too.
-Who else?

284
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,068
That's it. Oh, Mallory's going.

285
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,996
You, Sam, Mallory, the president
and an Icelandic delegation.

286
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,872
-Hang on.
-What?

287
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,309
-I can't go.
-Why not?

288
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,068
There'II be State Department people.
I just added a new deputy.

289
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,198
Most people I interviewed
were from State.

290
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,240
The Kennedy Center's gonna be
packed with people I rejected.

291
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,712
So is the bar at the Four Seasons.
Be there. T ell Sam.

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,230
-Carol?
-Yeah.

293
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,159
Have someone go to my apartment
and pick up my blue Armani.

294
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,959
-And a pair of shoes.
-Yeah.

295
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,396
The president wants us
to go to the concert...

296
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,995
...so we can discuss broader themes
for the classroom.

297
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,034
Great. It should be about more
than rocks and average rainfall.

298
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,034
-God, doe's it rain on Mars?
-No, but I'm saying....

299
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,078
The White House should develop
a broader theme.

300
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,870
That's right. And I think it's incredible
the president's asked us.

301
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,071
We should attack with energy
due the moment.

302
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,749
-Mallory's gonna be there.
-I can't go.

303
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,874
I'd think that, faced with the privilege of
attacking with energy due the moment--

304
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,388
Screw the moment. I can't go.

305
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,995
As we used to say in my hometown,
"That's just hard cheese. "

306
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,755
That's a real AIgonquin Round T able
you grew up with.

307
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,077
That is, Iike, the fourth time
I've been called dumb today.

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,476
I never called her after the picture...

309
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,708
...of me and Laurie
in the newspaper. I never...

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,672
...called her. She never called me.

311
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,555
You haven't spoken since the picture?
You didn't see her at the hospital?

312
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,308
I mean, I did, but-- No.

313
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,199
She started seeing somebody.

314
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,035
Did I tell you not to get a crush
on the boss's daughter?

315
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,159
Yeah. Don't you have a vegetable
crisis to fix or something?

316
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,914
-Yes.
-Okay.

317
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,591
The warhead didn't detonate.
The SS-1 9's had just been downloaded.

318
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,997
-But you're ready to confirm...?
-An SS-1 9 Stiletto ballistic missile...

319
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,833
...blew up in its silo, yes.

320
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,949
-What do you think happened?
-Every morning at your briefing...

321
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,232
...you're told about the troubling state
of the Russian military.

322
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,988
-You just saw evidence of it.
-Somebody screwed up.

323
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,595
Either somebody screwed up
or a computer did.

324
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,957
You wanna know the truth? An early
warning ballistic missile system...

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,549
...and the troops who run it
mistakenly detected a bogey...

326
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,353
...from a flock of Norwegian geese.

327
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,193
Where are we with
the Russian ambassador?

328
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,671
She's still claiming
it's an oil refinery fire.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,072
Leo, I want you to see her as soon
as she can get here. Thank you.

330
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,952
Thank you, Mr. President.

331
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,994
Leo?

332
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,510
-Mike?
-Yeah.

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,030
Could you have the president's
NASA advisor come over?

334
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,992
Yes, sir. Can I tell him why?

335
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,035
We Iost the signal from Galileo.

336
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,353
-It's a stamp!
-Yes, but we have to remain neutral.

337
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,752
-It's a stamp!
-I understand that it's a stamp.

338
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,919
When it comes to statehood for Puerto
Rico, the US. has to remain neutral.

339
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,838
Puerto Rico's in the United States.

340
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,509
Thank you for that review
of fifth-grade social studies...

341
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,035
... but I meant the federal government
must remain neutral.

342
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,953
Puerto Rico's in the federal government.

343
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,032
They send a resident commissioner
to Congress.

344
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,550
-Who can't vote. That's beside the point.
-What is the point?

345
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,353
Aquino was in favor of statehood.

346
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,474
T o put him on a stamp would promote
his beliefs, which we can't do.

347
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,190
Because we have to remain neutral.
That's idiotic.

348
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,549
Like it's the first time.

349
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,910
He voiced an opinion,
so he can't be on a stamp?

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,549
Sides have been taken.

351
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,035
Former presidents.
The speaker. The minority Ieader.

352
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,671
They all say statehood is in
the Iong-term interest of Puerto Rico.

353
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,599
And that as it stands now,
3.8 million American citizens...

354
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,836
... have been relegated
to second-class status.

355
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,031
That's more people than Mississippi.

356
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,788
Mississippi's never minded being
relegated to second-class status.

357
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,190
You're gonna make your
bigoted Mississippi jokes?

358
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,879
-Yes, I am.
-Isn't anyone worried...

359
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,918
...that they're gonna
want independence?

360
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,356
Exactly no one is worried about that.

361
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,598
Because Puerto Rico is absolutely
dependent on US. manufacturing...

362
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,913
...which contributes 40% to the GDP
and accounts for 24% of their workforce.

363
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,919
-People don't sit still for tyranny.
-How is it tyranny?

364
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,590
Puerto Ricans have to register
to be drafted, yet they can't vote.

365
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,952
They' re expected to die for
a commander in chief they didn't elect?

366
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,908
We have colonized Puerto Rico,
and they will rise up against us.

367
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,998
-I think we can take them.
-That's what we said about the British.

368
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,836
-We took the British.
-You know what I'm saying.

369
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,599
Hardly ever.

370
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,995
-Josh.
-What's going on?

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,193
They know it entered the Martian
atmosphere at 3:01 p. m. Eastern.

372
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,870
They know it was on course, traveling
at 1 5,400 miles per hour...

373
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,474
...which it was supposed to.

374
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,673
During its descent it was also
supposed to release two probes...

375
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,157
...firing them deep into the ground
as part of the mission's search...

376
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,152
...for evidence of water
under the surface.

377
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,914
We think if we hit the ground hard...

378
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,874
...we can make it to the center
of the planet and find water?

379
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,399
That's not a theory of physics pretty
much disproved by Wile E. Coyote?

380
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,028
The probes were supposed
to send a signal back to Earth.

381
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,788
-We haven't gotten the signal.
-The Iast the flight control heard...

382
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,277
...was 1 1 minutes before Ianding when
all systems were operating normally.

383
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,875
Then it entered
a communications blackout period...

384
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,993
...and hasn't been heard from since.
I know how it feels.

385
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,350
-What are they trying?
-The things they try.

386
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,552
I'm gonna give it an hour, and then
tell Leo to cancel the classroom.

387
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,750
-Josh?
-Yeah?

388
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,916
The stamp?

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,470
You were supposed to do this,
you know.

390
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,036
-I delegated.
-Yeah.

391
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,796
I've got more index cards.

392
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,514
C.J.?

393
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,034
-I'm Iate.
-Where are you going?

394
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,829
I have to go be with people
who don't Iike me.

395
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,235
-You can do that here.
-Sorry.

396
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,669
-We're Iate.
-You're going too?

397
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,316
-The president wants to discuss themes.
-I don't think there will be a classroom.

398
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,676
-The president's holding out hope.
-In the meantime...

399
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,712
...Mallory's gonna be there
with her boyfriend...

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,231
...and it's gonna be weird because
we haven't spoken since the picture...

401
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,433
...which was wrong. But I'm not even
sure there was an obligation to do that.

402
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,757
Let's remember, it's not Iike
we were dating. It was a flirtation.

403
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,918
We had one date and the rest
were all with groups of people.

404
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,952
I don't even know
what dating is anymore.

405
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,390
That's 20 seconds of my Iife
I'II never get back.

406
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,033
Let's go.

407
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,032
Mr. McGarry will be here in a moment.

408
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,475
Yes.

409
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,990
Are you sure I can't get you anything?

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,872
No, thank you.

411
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,999
I'II be waiting outside, then.

412
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,751
If you need anything, please,
don't hesitate to shout my name...

413
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,871
...which is Margaret.

414
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,999
Yes.

415
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,799
The Russian ambassador's here.

416
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,548
I Ieft her alone, because I think
I was freaking her out.

417
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,910
It wouldn't surprise me.

418
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,951
-Madame Ambassador.
-Leo.

419
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,719
Thank you for coming.

420
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,714
-You Iook handsome, Leo.
-Thank you.

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,913
-You Iook very nice yourself.
-You get more handsome every year.

422
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,629
And you're having your suits
handmade now.

423
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,595
-Nadia, are you hitting on me?
-I was sorry to hear about your divorce.

424
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,918
-You have a fire in a missile silo.
-It is an oil refinery.

425
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,392
These are Keyhole
satellite photographs.

426
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,989
Would you point please
to the oil refinery in these pictures?

427
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,317
I am not in the position to comment
on matters of national security.

428
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,559
Okay, can you tell me how an oil refinery
explosion would affect national security?

429
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,990
This should be taken up
with the foreign minister.

430
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,352
I'm taking it up with the Russian
ambassador to the United States.

431
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,233
Is your country ready to deny there
was an explosion at Sego Silo 1 4-D?

432
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
We know how to deal
with these kinds of emergencies.

433
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,077
We have guys who train for it
all the time.

434
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,156
Ask us for help.

435
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,874
-Do we know what they' re playing?
-I'm sorry, sir?

436
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,278
The Reykjavik Symphony. Do we know
what they' re playing and for how Iong?

437
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,120
-It says, "An Evening of Modern Music. "
-T urn the car around.

438
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,034
"The orchestra features 90 pieces
including anvils and castanets. "

439
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,476
-T urn the car around.
-Modern music is cool.

440
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,275
Modern music sucks.
Anything written after 1 860 sucks.

441
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,273
-"Samuel Barber. Symphony No. 2. "
-Sucks.

442
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,751
-"Stravinsky. Variations on a Theme. "
-Sucks.

443
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,759
-"Enlightened Night for string orchestra. "
-T otally blows.

444
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,508
"They'II be performing
the world premiere of a piece...

445
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,318
PIayed on teapots and gefilte fish.

446
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,994
... by a new Icelandic composer. "

447
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,675
He got so nervous
when he heard you were coming...

448
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,030
... he was rewriting the piece
until 6:00.

449
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,914
If he wants more time,
I'm happy to take a rain check.

450
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,228
-I thought you Iiked classical music.
-I do, but this is not classical music.

451
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,439
It is not classical music if the guy
finished writing it this afternoon.

452
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,108
He's here. Here we go.

453
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,839
Moving in.

454
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,154
-C.J.!
-Yes, sir.

455
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,037
-A broader theme.
-Sam and I'II be talking about it.

456
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,231
I don't get many opportunities
to talk to kids.

457
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,159
At some point, I'm gonna have to
pull the plug to give enough notice.

458
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,279
-But Iet's Iet them work for a while.
-Yes, sir.

459
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,990
-Where's Sam?
-He's inside hiding from Mallory.

460
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,191
-Why is he hiding?
-Do you really wanna know?

461
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,596
-Not at all.
-I didn't think so.

462
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,078
Hey, Sam.

463
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,240
-How you doing, Sam?
-Good.

464
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,116
-Hey, Sam.
-Benny.

465
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,319
Hey, Sam.

466
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,798
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

467
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,229
Good.

468
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,029
-And you?
-Good.

469
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,551
Excellent. Can I just say
that I was the one who was in trouble?

470
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,114
It was my picture in the paper...

471
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,712
...and I don't know why I needed
to call you and explain myself.

472
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,228
It was you and a call girl.

473
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,039
Like there aren't pictures
of you and a call girl?

474
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,675
No, there aren't any pictures of me
and a call girl.

475
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,349
-Well, that's a crime.
-If you'd picked up the phone--

476
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,039
-Who's your boyfriend?
-I don't think--

477
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,670
-What's his name?
-His name is Richard Andrewchuk.

478
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,349
-There's a hockey player named that.
-Unless there are two....

479
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,029
-You're dating Richard Andrewchuk?
-We're having a Iot of sex.

480
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,794
-You'd have to.
-What doe's that mean?

481
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,356
-What the hell do you two talk about?
-He happens to be terribly bright.

482
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,677
-Good, because he's a bad player.
-He's had injury problems.

483
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,030
-From falling down.
-Look, I came over here--

484
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,639
Excuse me.

485
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,038
Excuse me.

486
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,350
I took trombone Iessons
when I was a kid.

487
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,108
Not much solo music
written for trombone...

488
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,192
...but I wanted to play
in the marching band.

489
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,353
The thing was, my arms were too short
to reach seventh position.

490
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,035
One afternoon during a game,
I gave it all I had...

491
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,795
...and ended up throwing a slide
into the end zone...

492
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,310
...which is more than I could say
for our quarterback.

493
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,989
Would you excuse me
just one moment?

494
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,554
-Galileo?
-No, sir, the oil refinery.

495
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,308
-Yeah, what?
-You'II need a Pentagon briefing.

496
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,429
The explosion occurred while
Iiquid hydrogen was being drained.

497
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,879
Okay.

498
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,837
-What about Galileo?
-They' re working on it.

499
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,111
-Okay.
-I'II get a statement ready.

500
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,594
Yeah.

501
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,629
-Someone was draining hydrogen?
-Yeah.

502
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,355
-Mr. President?
-Yeah?

503
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,790
-Your box is ready.
-Thanks.

504
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,589
-Toby Ziegler.
-Thanks.

505
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,030
-You'II need to take it outside.
-Yeah.

506
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,634
C.J.?

507
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,872
They said modern music? I thought
that meant Jackson Browne.

508
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,435
-Jackson Browne is modern?
-Used to be.

509
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,914
-Yeah, Iook....
-Yeah?

510
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,670
Twice a year the kitchen staff has
writers come in from food magazines.

511
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,474
They were in Iast week,
and I mentioned to one of them....

512
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,716
I said the president
doe'sn't Iike green beans.

513
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,274
-Why?
-Because he doe'sn't.

514
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,913
-How did you say it?
-What?

515
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,510
-What question did they ask?
-" Is there any food he Iikes or dislikes? "

516
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,115
I said he Iikes steaks, Iobster,
spaghetti, ice cream.

517
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,879
-And?
-He doe'sn't Iike green beans.

518
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,635
-Did you Ieave any wiggle room?
-Wiggle room?

519
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,037
-He doe'sn't Iike green beans.
-We won Oregon by 1 0,000 votes.

520
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,948
If they have 1 0,001 green bean
farmers, then we're screwed.

521
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,275
-C.J.--
-This is serious.

522
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,869
I'm sorry I mouthed off to a reporter,
but you're crazy.

523
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,999
Education's a serious thing.
Crime. Jobs. National security.

524
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,875
I've been to Oregon four times, and not
a single person I've met has been stupid.

525
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,396
Everybody's stupid in an election year.

526
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,752
No, everybody gets treated stupid
in an election year.

527
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,111
AII right. From now on, there's
no food the president doe'sn't Iike.

528
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,919
-Yeah.
-I have to take this outside.

529
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,269
Yeah.

530
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,869
-Can you hear me?
-Where are you?

531
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,033
I'm out in back. I passed
Gary Saunders on the way out.

532
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,876
He booed me. I swear to God,
I passed by, he went, " Boo. "

533
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,070
Who's Gary Saunders?

534
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,954
Deputy spokesperson
at the Department of Energy.

535
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,231
- You didn 't hire him.
-I promoted Simon GIazer.

536
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,516
-I promoted from within, Toby.
-Anyway...

537
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,268
...they' re hypothesizing the thing
came down at an odd angle...

538
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,759
...and its position might be preventing
it from establishing a downlink.

539
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,031
They say it'll take a few days
to try everything.

540
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,435
-Days?
- Yeah.

541
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,709
Oh, God!

542
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,831
If this is the worst thing
that happens--

543
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,873
No, T ad Whitney
is coming over to me.

544
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,593
You interviewed Tad?

545
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,031
Oh, God, he's got me in his tractor
beam. He's walking right over.

546
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,959
-Goodbye.
-I'm not very good at confrontation.

547
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,028
-You have no problem with me.
-Is the water in the Potomac very cold?

548
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,515
If you rub chicken fat on yourself,
it'II insulate.

549
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,199
Don't hang up.
If it seems Iike I'm talking--

550
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,268
Hey, C.J.

551
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,068
Yeah, okay.

552
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,272
We're gonna put those figures out
at the morning briefing and-- Yeah.

553
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,429
Thank you.

554
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,153
What was that about?

555
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,991
You know, I honestly
couldn't tell you.

556
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,988
-I saw you come out.
-Yeah, there's some stuff going on.

557
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,598
-I didn't get the gig, huh?
-I gave it to Simon GIazer.

558
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,030
-I heard.
-I promoted from within.

559
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,431
-Yeah.
-Promoting from within...

560
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,119
...is very big in my family.

561
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,558
Yeah, I'm surprised,
because I'm pretty qualified.

562
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,149
In fact, a Iot of people at State
thought I was a Iock.

563
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,996
-You're very qualified.
-Yeah, and it wasn't because I'm a man.

564
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,477
-Well, no. Simon GIazer's a man.
-I suppose.

565
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,670
Hey.

566
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,794
-It wasn't because I stopped seeing you?
-It honestly was a matter of Simon....

567
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,039
No, of course, it didn't have
anything to do with....

568
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,278
That was six weeks
five years ago.

569
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,916
I thought you might want
an explanation as to why I did.

570
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,589
-Why you did what?
-Why I stopped calling you.

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,718
I don't need an explanation.

572
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,276
Believe me, it wasn't because you
were bad in bed or anything Iike that.

573
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,789
No, I didn't think it was, T ad.

574
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,072
I mention it because I know
a Iot of women who worry about that.

575
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,998
-I don't.
-You're good in bed.

576
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,033
I'm great in bed.

577
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,798
-How you doing?
-C.J.--

578
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,389
I'm sorry you didn't get the job.
But there's really--

579
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,591
You're really gonna tell me
this isn't personal?

580
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,518
-I really am.
-I think it is.

581
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,232
I think it's personal and unprofessional,
and people are gonna know about this.

582
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,074
-I think you've got a problem.
-I have a number of problems today.

583
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,913
You're not close to being any of them.

584
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,072
I was hoping we could be
adult about this.

585
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,198
I have to go.
You're gonna get a briefing.

586
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,875
-On what?
-A Russian missile silo.

587
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,912
-Listen....
-Yeah?

588
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,430
PIaying along with this for a moment...

589
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,391
...is there anything I should do
to improve my chances next time around?

590
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,953
Well, when we run for reelection,
I'd vote for somebody else.

591
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
-Read the Iast part back to me.
- "The flight manager at JPL...

592
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,868
... will work around the clock
until hope is exhausted. "

593
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,519
-Okay.
-I'II give it to Carol.

594
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,438
- Yeah.
-Is she there?

595
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,194
-Mallory?
- Yeah.

596
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,994
Y eah, she's here.
She snuck up on me from behind.

597
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,999
You'd think women would make
more noise with those high heels.

598
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,750
They've got this stealth thing going,
which I ought to be clever enough to--

599
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,714
-What was that?
-Nothing.

600
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,833
-She's there, right?
-Yeah.

601
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,395
-How's she look?
-She Iooks pretty good.

602
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,956
-Can you describe what she 's wearing?
-Yeah. She's standing in front of me.

603
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,793
-Wanna get off the phone?
- Yeah.

604
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,149
Okay.

605
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,998
-You know what I think?
-What?

606
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,192
You're caught between
wanting to be mad...

607
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,238
...and wanting good seats
for home games.

608
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,715
I get pretty good seats. I don't know
if you noticed the motorcade I rode in.

609
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,033
I spoke to my dad.
I'm sorry about Galileo.

610
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,710
-They've got a Iot of tests they can try.
-How much money is it gonna cost?

611
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,116
-Don't start with me.
-I'm asking as a taxpayer.

612
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,595
It cost $ 1 65 million
to Iose the thing.

613
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,269
How much more will it cost
to make sure you'II never find it?

614
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,588
I don't know, but we won't divert
municipal tax dollars...

615
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,797
...which are best spent
on new hockey arenas.

616
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,469
It's best spent feeding, housing
and educating people.

617
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,798
There are a Iot of hungry people.
None of them are hungry...

618
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,958
...none of them are colder or dumber
because we went to the moon.

619
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,515
We went to the moon.
Do we have to go to Mars? Why?

620
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,473
Because it's next.
Because we came out of the cave...

621
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,155
...and we Iooked over the hill
and we saw fire...

622
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,954
...and we crossed the ocean,
and we pioneered the West...

623
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,509
...and we took to the sky.

624
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,872
The history of man is hung on a timeline
of exploration, and this is what's next.

625
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,994
-I know.
-People Iike you who say that--

626
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,999
-What?
-I said, I know.

627
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,869
-We're supposed to be explorers.
-Then, what the hell--?

628
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,430
-I Iike hearing you talk about it.
-You know--

629
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,358
-You get puffed up.
-You're a pain in the ass.

630
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,034
Yes.

631
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,798
Anyway, Iook, about the picture--

632
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,752
-Don't worry about it tonight.
-You're not pissed?

633
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,635
I'm totally pissed, but I'm saying
don't worry about it tonight.

634
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,836
-Sam?
-Yeah?

635
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,909
-I appreciate that. Thank you.
-Yeah.

636
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,839
-Hey, Mal.
-Hey, C.J.

637
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,758
Let me see what you got.

638
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
This will be for tonight,
but doe'sn't include notes from JPL.

639
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,879
-I gotta talk to Jason Stark.
-Yeah.

640
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,879
-What you got there?
-Precedent, baby!

641
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,031
-Precedent?
-Precedent.

642
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,988
The mother's milk of making
your point and being right.

643
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,190
Okay.

644
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,152
The Jewish War Veterans
Iobbied to get a stamp...

645
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,990
...even though the criteria prohibits
groups whose undertakings are religious.

646
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,429
Right, and what happened?

647
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,996
The JWV argued that their achievements
have been fighting wars. Like Aquino.

648
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,550
-Right, and what happened?
-They were denied.

649
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,074
-Yes.
-Okay, that doe'sn't help me.

650
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,231
Hang on!

651
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,915
-The Iuna moth has its own stamp.
-What's a Iuna moth?

652
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,437
You don't see the National Organization
of Entomologists freaking out.

653
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,995
-No, but I'd pay good money to see that.
-Hang on.

654
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,669
-Here we go.
-These groups were issued stamps:

655
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,679
Disabled Veterans of America.
United Confederate Veterans.

656
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,912
And the black soldiers who served
as buffalo scouts in the West.

657
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,590
-You gonna get that?
-I meant in the 1 9th century.

658
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,552
I didn't think we still
had buffalo scouts.

659
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,235
That guy should be able
to be on a stamp.

660
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,192
-What was that?
-The president's back.

661
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,717
Any inspection team will have
to include neutral representatives.

662
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,955
-Who?
-The Finns.

663
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,472
I'II take it to the State Department, but
they' re not gonna wanna accept Iimits.

664
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,910
No one enters our country
without our approval.

665
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,871
-They'II agree to notification.
-I'II insist on notification and approval.

666
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,999
Results from the inspection
will remain in the country--

667
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,869
-Nadia!
-Leo, soil samples, carbon residue...

668
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,718
... photographs
and photographic negatives.

669
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,072
-Listen--
-That must remain under Russian control.

670
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,950
Your paranoia was a Iot sexier back
when you guys were Communists, Nadia.

671
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,789
Mr. President, how good to see you.

672
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,193
Where do you get the nerve to try and
dictate terms on this? Are you insane?

673
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,997
Your missile regiment is in
a horrifying state of disrepair.

674
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,710
Your best-trained operators
have Ieft or died.

675
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,594
The ones you've got aren't paid much,
when they' re paid at all.

676
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,350
Your ICBMs are well beyond
their warranty Iife.

677
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,915
Seven weeks ago, you mistook a
Norwegian weather rocket for a missile...

678
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,997
... because the CrossT ac information...

679
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,271
... never made it to the Russian
C and C system.

680
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,235
Leo, at the time the SS-1 9 exploded...

681
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,750
...it was being drained
of its Iiquid hydrogen...

682
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,679
...in an attempt by deserting
soldiers to, wait for it--

683
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,190
-Steal the warhead?
-Steal the warhead.

684
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,159
When were you gonna tell us
about that?

685
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,756
-Do you realize how dangerous--?
-Mr. President.

686
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,793
You shouldn't be concerned
with the welfare of the Russian people.

687
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,079
Well, I am concerned,
but that's not what they pay me for.

688
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,433
You guys fall asleep, and I've got
a hemisphere hiding under the bed.

689
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,917
How do you not tell us this is going on?
How do you not ask us for help?

690
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,672
We'II not need help finding the Ieaders
of the black-market network--

691
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,474
Yeah, thanks.
We're sending in NATO inspectors.

692
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,988
We were discussing the terms.

693
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,316
The terms are we're sending
in NATO inspectors...

694
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,278
...or he's taking a walk
to the press room.

695
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,910
Get your foreign minister
on the phone.

696
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,910
I really don't know from where
you guys get the nerve.

697
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,918
From a Iong, hard winter.

698
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,999
Mr. President.

699
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,876
This is still my office, right?

700
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,673
-We have some things for discussion.
-Nothing new from NASA?

701
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,111
They' re testing the idea it may
have turned into a "safe mode. "

702
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,039
If it sensed trouble, it's programmed
to turn its systems off...

703
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,152
...and wait for instructions
from Earth.

704
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,955
-Earth's giving it instructions.
-It's not responding.

705
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,309
Like my kids. AII right.

706
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,273
That Ieaves us with the televised
classroom, the green beans--

707
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,749
-The stamp.
-The stamp.

708
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,918
And depending on who those people
were that were standing near me...

709
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,953
...the possibility of a story
about me being good in bed.

710
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,835
-Good in bed?
-Yes.

711
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,076
-Why?
-Because I am.

712
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,632
-Okay.
-Green beans?

713
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,515
Let's do a photo op with the president
eating green beans.

714
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,998
We can drop in a quote, "He's always
Iooking for new green bean recipes. "

715
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,916
We'II schedule a pop in Oregon
and make sure nothing burned down.

716
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,833
Yeah, okay. What about the stamp?

717
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,917
The Citizens' Stamp
Advisory Committee--

718
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,872
-The president doe'sn't Iike green beans.
-What?

719
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,999
I'm sorry, sir. Nothing.

720
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,595
-The Citizens' Stamp--
-No, I'm sorry.

721
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,952
I said, you don't Iike green beans, sir.

722
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,719
He doe'sn't enjoy them.

723
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,468
He doe'sn't think the people
who make them are evil.

724
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,631
They're simply not his cup of tea.

725
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,276
Why don't we think the adults
of Oregon will be okay with that?

726
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,994
Josh, why do you think
adult Americans can't understand...

727
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,798
...that we can honor a man's contribution
without subscribing to his politics?

728
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,958
People stopped trusting
government during Vietnam...

729
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,629
...and it was because government
stopped trusting them.

730
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,388
It's a cautionary tale, Josh.

731
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,519
Okay, I-- I was gonna say I think
we should put him on the stamp.

732
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,195
-Okay, good.
-Yeah.

733
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,948
Everybody go away. We'II call you
when there's a NASA update.

734
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,953
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

735
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,750
-Nothing. I just--
-C.J.?

736
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,951
-Did you hear the end of the concert?
-I didn't hear much. How was it?

737
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,472
Well, first of all, Iet's not kid ourselves.
The Reykjavik Symphony can play.

738
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,398
These guys have some serious game.

739
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,873
In this particular case, their talents
were tragically misapplied...

740
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,720
...to an atonal nightmare of pretension.

741
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,159
But after intermission....

742
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,192
After intermission?

743
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,955
They played a piece
by a new composer.

744
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,719
At first I wasn't hearing.

745
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,709
I had 1 9 different things on my mind,
but then I did. And C.J....

746
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,912
It was magnificent.
It was genius.

747
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,034
He built themes, and at the beginning
it was an intellectual exercise...

748
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,438
...which is fun enough, I guess, but then
in the fourth movement he just Iet it go.

749
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,955
I really didn't think I could be
surprised by music anymore.

750
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,713
I thought about all the times...

751
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,310
...this guy must have heard
that his music was no good.

752
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,150
I've gotta write this guy a Ietter.

753
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,754
Mr. President, about that
televised classroom tomorrow--

754
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,112
I'm gonna wait up for a while
to see if we hear anything.

755
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,311
It's out there somewhere.

756
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,792
It's so close.

757
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,310
I think you should do the classroom
either way.

758
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,990
Yeah?

759
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,955
We have at our disposal
a captive audience of schoolchildren.

760
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,954
Some of them don't go to
the blackboard or raise their hand...

761
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,993
... because they think they'II be wrong.

762
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,950
You should say to these kids,
"You think you get it wrong sometimes?

763
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,312
You should come down here
and see how the big boys do it. "

764
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,275
You should tell them you haven't given
up hope, and that it may turn up.

765
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,832
But in the meantime, you want NASA
to put its best people in a room...

766
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,078
...and you want them
to start building Galileo 6.

767
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,476
Some of them will Iaugh
and most won't care...

768
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,398
... but for some,
they might honestly see...

769
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,998
...that it's about going to
the blackboard and raising your hand.

770
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,911
And that's the broader theme.

771
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,473
I'II say.

772
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,632
I'II be in my office, Mr. President.

773
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,830
-C.J.?
-Yes, sir.

774
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,039
You said it right that time.

775
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,232
I'II be in my office.

776
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,351
Talk to us.

777
