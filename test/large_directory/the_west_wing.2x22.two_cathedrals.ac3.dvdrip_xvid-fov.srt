-Previously on The West Wing :
-Do you get that you have MS?

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,551
We're firming up strategy
on the future...

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,678
...and we don't know if this president
is interested in the future.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,992
-What am I supposed to tell my director?
-We need 30 minutes Wednesday.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,196
Order the attorney general
to appoint a prosecutor.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,998
How many are they estimating?

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,436
Two Bradleys with 1 20 mm
cannons and a couple artillery tubes.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,397
-What do we have?
-37 Marines with M-1 4s.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,108
There was an accident
at 1 8th and Potomac.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,117
Mrs. Landingham was driving
her car back.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,352
-Is she all right?
-No, she's dead.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,030
Most of us are just hearing
the news now.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,468
-A conference call?
-Y es.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,478
-There hasn't been time to digest this.
-What we do know is...

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,234
...the House Democrats
are gonna take it in the throat.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,949
We might get voters to accept MS
in some of the suburban districts.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,799
-The whole House is up for re-election.
-Yeah.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,634
It's not a matter of accepting it.
There was a cover-up--

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,674
-The point is, even if you squeeze out--
-Even if you could squeeze out a win...

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,876
...this is what the campaign's
gonna be about.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,712
And Democrats
will tell the president:

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,030
" Don't come to my district,
I got troubles enough. "

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,236
Your campaign never gets out
of the rose garden.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,597
We're running without a standard-bearer
when we got policy cases...

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,678
...against the Republicans on tax cuts,
environment, education.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,070
And this is what the campaign's
gonna be about.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,271
Leo, most of us
are just hearing the news...

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,478
...and I don't Iike being the first one
to say it, but I'm gonna.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,714
I think the president has got to strongly
consider not running for re-election.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,795
-You think you' re the first one to say it?
-Leo--

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,191
You are, at minimum, the 35th
in the Iast two hours.

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,558
Well, we'rethe ones talking to you now.
And we'rethe ones that are asking:

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,190
Is the president gonna run
for re-election?

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,996
Harry, Bill...

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,878
...there's going to be
a press conference tonight. I'd watch.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,430
He'II sit here
with the first Iady on his right.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,795
-Not in front of the fireplace?
-That's too much.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,197
He'II sit here. They'II have to Iight
the room from outside the window.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,635
-We'II Iet them know.
-Last time, they didn't know.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,598
The president taped a message
that Iooked Iike it was Iit by Ed Wood.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,830
A pitcher of water,
but keep it off-screen.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,070
They gotta Iight
from outside the window.

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,512
I don't care. Look, Toby, has anyone
considered whether he's up for this?

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,790
-Up for this?
-Some stuff has happened since--

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
C.J. gave it to the network.
We're pretty much Iocked in.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,756
-When are we prepping him?
-After the service.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,195
-There's gonna be time?
-We'II have the afternoon.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,510
-We should consider--
-There aren't any options.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,790
We're going on TV at 8.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,115
-Toby?
-Y eah?

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,595
I had to put Greg Summerhays
back on your schedule.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,553
-No, I took him off.
-Leo's office had me put him back on.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,399
-Why?
-They want you to keep the appointment.

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,149
We've got her funeral today.
We've got these....

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,669
I said 4:00.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,791
Y eah, all right.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,358
-Carol?
-Y eah?

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,314
AP, Reuters, Agence France. Something
about seating on Air Force One.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,353
-Seating arrangements?
-Seating arrangements on Air Force One.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,475
C.J.?

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,716
I was thinking since it's gonna be
a Iight day...

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,309
... I'd maybe blow off work,
go shopping or something.

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,955
What do you need?

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,636
-Can I give you a quick brief?
-Sure.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,150
The Justice Department's run out
of money in their suit against tobacco.

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,710
-The Justice Department's overmatched.
-By hundreds of millions of dollars.

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,593
They' re asking for 30 million.
We think they should have it.

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,830
-Who disagrees with us?
-8 of the 1 5 members...

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,549
...of the subcommittee that controls
the budgets for Justice and Commerce...

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,915
...including Kalmbach
who has ties to tobacco...

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,877
...and Warren and Rossitter, who do not.

72
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,913
-We Iost two Democrats?
-They have ideological objections.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,028
Y eah, it's just not a good time
to be Iosing Democrats.

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,356
You haven't been in my office
this morning.

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,472
-We'II get them back.
-Anyway, Leo felt pretty strongly...

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,992
...that we should Iight a fire under it,
so I wrote up a strongly worded release.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,112
"The White House. For immediate
release. Office of the press.

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,676
T oday, the president calls on Congress,
who deserve their day in court.

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,871
This administration
won't sit on the bench...

80
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,877
...while the Appropriations Committee...

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,713
...choke off funding for a Iawsuit
aimed at perpetrators...

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,354
...of hundreds of thousands
of negligent homicides...

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,636
...while filling their campaign
war chests. "

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,435
This is Iike the fire we used to throw
in the early primaries.

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,638
Let Bartlet be Bartlet.

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,036
You gotta put it away for a while.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,752
You think?

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,633
I'm going in there to tell them
a helicopter assault team...

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,355
...is steaming off Port-au-Prince, then
I'm bringing in AP and Agence France.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,715
Nobody's gonna write
about an Appropriations Bill.

91
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,155
Haiti is gonna get bumped
to the Lifestyle Section.

92
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,799
Yeah, I suppose.

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,111
Listen.

94
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,669
-Have you seen him today?
-No, have you?

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,753
No.

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,679
-AII right. Listen, I gotta--
-Y eah. Thanks.

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,236
-Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?
-PIease.

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,796
Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?
You don't think Wedland's gonna get in?

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,150
-Hutchinson, Seth Gillette?
-PIease.

100
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,069
-Gillette's Iucky if he carries his family.
-It's Hoynes.

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,319
Sam, you understand this conversation
isn't ruling out Bartlet as a candidate.

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,478
It's just, "what if? "
We're party strategists.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,591
-It's what we'repaid for.
-Y eah.

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,075
Hoynes is the only one
who put together the money.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,800
He's the most successful fundraiser
the party's ever had.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,111
Though obviously, it'd be easier
if Hoynes is running as an incumbent.

107
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,753
-Okay.
-Sam--

108
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,757
-Thanks.
-No, it was an inappropriate--

109
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,430
No, when I say okay, that's it.
CIose your notebooks.

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,916
You don't talk Iike that here. I don't give
a damn whose nephew you are.

111
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,436
T ony, President Bartlet's not
a candidate. He's the president.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,310
-What are the conditions in the embassy?
-They've got running water...

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,631
... but the power's been cut.
The generator's got about 24 hours.

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,795
Injuries?

115
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,918
No, but the deputy chief's a diabetic
and running out of insulin.

116
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,116
-The Red Cross can help us there?
-Yes, sir.

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,275
What's outside?

118
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,193
About 1 200 troops
with A-1 5s positioned outside the gates.

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,231
They've got four 1 05 mm howitzers.

120
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,908
-Which are trained at...?
-Our front door.

121
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Mr. President, we want to send
Fitzwallace down there.

122
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,835
Why?

123
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,395
There's a Haitian general
named Francis St. Jacques.

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,275
He trained with Fitz in Annapolis and....

125
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,398
Jed?

126
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,952
-Jed?
-Jed. Jed, your father's calling you.

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,195
Jed!

128
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,997
-Didn't you hear me calling you?
-No, sir, I didn't. I was-- I didn't.

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,670
Mr. Spence found this cigarette butt
on the floor in the aisle of the chapel.

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,950
People shouldn't put
cigarettes out in chapel.

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,476
People shouldn't be smoking
in the chapel I think is my point, Jed.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,199
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,635
-Could you tell your friends, please?
-Y eah.

134
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,519
Jed, hang on.
I want you to meet someone.

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,757
She's gonna take over
in my office for Mrs. Tillinghouse.

136
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,832
Excuse me. This is Dolores Landingham.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,510
Mrs. Landingham,
this is my eldest son, Jed.

138
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,229
-So, what happens?
-Basically, we think we can get...

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,510
.. St. Jacques to fracture Bazan's army.

140
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,349
-So if we invade...?
-It becomes peacekeeping.

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,838
Okay, send Fitzwallace down.
Anything else?

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,957
No, sir.

143
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,313
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Thank you, sir.

144
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,115
-They've been in there 48 hours.
-Y es, sir.

145
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,675
The guy's been president
of his country for two days.

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,189
-He's spent them both at gunpoint.
-Y eah.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,998
What do you know about this storm?

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,794
-It's moving to South Carolina.
-It's supposed to be bad.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,479
-It's a tropical storm.
-Y es, sir.

150
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,035
No, I mean, it's been designated
a tropical storm.

151
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,595
That means it has a surface wind
speed of something.

152
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,755
Y es, sir.

153
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,839
Isn't it strange to have
a tropical storm in May?

154
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,190
I'm sure there's a season
and this isn't it.

155
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,233
-I can have someone find out for you.
-It's not a big deal.

156
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,868
It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.

157
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,718
The motorcade will Ieave
for the cathedral in an hour.

158
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,673
-You ever been to National Cathedral?
-Y es, sir.

159
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,156
You know you can Iay the Washington
Monument on its side in that church.

160
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,392
-I did, actually.
-We should try it.

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,477
You have two meetings
between now and then.

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,752
-Is there anything else you need, sir?
-I need pallbearers.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,712
Y es, sir.

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,915
AIso in the combat radius
will be six JSOCs...

165
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,669
...a battalion Ianding team. They'II cover
that at the Pentagon briefing.

166
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,870
Doe's the OAS passing a resolution
allowing you...

167
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,237
...to explore military options mean
you've exhausted diplomatic ones?

168
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,278
Of course not. But it should
underline the consequences for Bazan...

169
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,750
...should he decide to arrest the
democratically elected president of Haiti.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,274
That's all I have for now.

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,072
Before you go, C.J. needs to see...

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,435
...AP, Reuters and Agence France
in the office.

173
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,313
She needs to discuss seating
arrangements on Air Force One.

174
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,233
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,436
-We've got a problem.
-That's hard to believe.

176
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,989
We can't have the press conference
in the East Room.

177
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,277
-What are you talking about?
-We can't have it in the East Room.

178
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,277
-Why?
-They've been pulling the wiring...

179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,192
...and they found asbestos.

180
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,511
-There's asbestos in the East Room?
-Y eah. I'm gonna make a Iist--

181
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,632
Okay. Put together a Iist
of alternatives.

182
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,795
Come on in.

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,155
I don't have a problem
with my seat on the plane.

184
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,958
Get inside.

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,234
I complained that one time because,
I don't know, I was in a bad mood.

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,910
This isn't about seating arrangements.
Notebooks. No tape recorders.

187
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,792
The story's embargoed for an hour...

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,952
...and you'II identify me
as a "senior White House official. "

189
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,633
-Are we talking about the opening bell?
-That depends. When is it gonna Ieak?

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,070
-I'm sorry.
-When are we Ieaking the story?

191
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,238
-C.J. 's doing it right now.
-Wall Street will have it in an hour.

192
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,353
In two hours
sellers will outnumber buyers.

193
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,112
Excuse me, keep going.

194
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,959
-In what sectors?
-In all sectors of the--

195
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,029
-Charlie?
-Y es, sir.

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,835
Do you have any idea why the door
to the portico keeps swinging open?

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,673
They' re replacing the Iatch.
It's swinging open from the wind.

198
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,795
The door opens out.

199
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,350
When the right doors are open,
there's a wind tunnel into the Oval Office.

200
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,073
No kidding.

201
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,793
What about Europe and Japan?

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,073
Well, Japan is going to be up
and trading by the time we go on TV.

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,114
Charlie says there's a wind tunnel
created by something.

204
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,231
They' re fixing the Iatch.

205
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,429
-Mr. President.
-Y eah?

206
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,710
-Is the motorcade ready?
-Y es, sir.

207
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,318
Okay.

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,796
Well, we've gotta go.

209
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,753
I don't know what to say.

210
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,636
Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can buy
some tech stocks and jack up the price.

211
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,628
-Keep me posted on the bellwethers.
-Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President.

212
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,960
-Is the first Iady meeting us in the car?
-Y es. It's a nondenominational service.

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,118
What'd she say?

214
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,432
She said the first Iady's
meeting us in the car.

215
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,433
-It wasn't a nondenominational service.
-Of course it was.

216
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,591
Wouldn't have felt that way
if you were Jewish.

217
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,671
It was a nondenominational
Christian service.

218
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,717
-Attendance at--
-It's nondenominational.

219
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,071
-Our Father is not nondenominational.
-Everyone says Our Father.

220
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,515
Catholics don't say,
" For thine is the kingdom...

221
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,269
...and the power and the glory forever
and ever. " You know? I'm just saying.

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,919
-Why do you work here?
-I'm sorry?

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,712
Why do you work here after classes?

224
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,434
I can't imagine anyone
in your family is on work study.

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,309
No, I get free tuition. So I guess
it's a good idea to give something back.

226
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,192
Why do you call your father "sir"?

227
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,830
-Is this a whole afternoon of questions?
-Actually, you've been talking.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,470
-I'm sorry, am I boring you, Dolores?
-Mrs. Landingham, please.

229
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,193
My father's the headmaster.

230
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,153
But before he was your headmaster,
he was your father, right?

231
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,237
I don't want anyone
to feel uncomfortable.

232
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,631
-So you call him "sir"?
-Y eah.

233
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,196
You know, they released the girl
from the hospital this morning.

234
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,636
-The driver?
-Y eah.

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,313
She fractured her wrist
and had some stitches over her eye...

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,835
...and the other two
had some scrapes and bruises.

237
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,391
It Iooks Iike they' re going to charge her
with vehicular manslaughter.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,996
Frank Mitchell, Joanna, Bill Carney...

239
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,196
...told me they were in
meetings all morning.

240
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,152
Y eah.

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,078
Consensus seems to be
that if you step back...

242
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,714
...and put your support behind Hoynes...

243
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,356
...there's a decent chance the Democrats
can keep the White House.

244
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,233
The world will rest easier.

245
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,276
We're here.

246
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,473
" ' I am the resurrection and I am Iife,'
says the Lord.

247
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,390
'Whoever believes in me shall Iive,
even though he die. ' "

248
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,513
God of mercy, you are the hope
of sinners, the joy of saints.

249
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,918
We pray for our sister Dolores, whose
body we honor with Christian burial.

250
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,789
Give her happiness with your saints,
and raise up her body...

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,757
...with the saints of the Iast day
to be in your presence forever.

252
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,480
As for me, I know
that my redeemer Iives...

253
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,153
...and that at the Iast
he will stand upon the earth.

254
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,679
-After my awaking, he will raise me up.
-Jed?

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,589
-And in my body I shall see God.
-Jed?

256
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,952
I myself shall see,
and my eyes behold him....

257
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,678
Jed?

258
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,553
Jed?

259
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,796
I'm trying to get through
an honest day's work.

260
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,915
You missed a spot.

261
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,913
I didn't miss it.
I just haven't gotten to it yet.

262
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,830
-You have a habit of doing that.
-What's that?

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,594
T elling me I'm doing something wrong
before I even do it.

264
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,716
Well, that must be a Iittle annoying.

265
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,836
-I got a project for you.
-Really.

266
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,109
You can show the courage...

267
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,914
...intellect and the Ieadership skills
everyone talks about.

268
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,917
I'm a Iittle busy hosing down the boats.

269
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,038
You know the women at this school
are paid Iess than the men?

270
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,277
-Sorry?
-The women are paid Iess than the men.

271
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,950
-No, I didn't know that.
-Do you think your father doe's?

272
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,232
The first reading will be
from Mr. Charles Young...

273
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,352
...from the Book of Wisdom,
Chapter Three.

274
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,477
I'd Iike an opportunity to make my case.

275
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,636
-What are you doing here?
-Raising an issue.

276
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,190
-You've been raising this issue all week.
-It's had quite an affect on you.

277
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,715
-Don't you have a husband?
-What relevance doe's that have?

278
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,115
Shouldn't you go home
when you' re done with work?

279
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,477
-Shouldn't you mind your own business?
-You're minding everybody else's--

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,914
What's that supposed to mean?

281
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,672
My family doe'sn't talk about money.

282
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,751
-That's because you have money.
-Numbers.

283
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,837
-Excuse me?
-If you want to convince me...

284
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,838
...of something, show me numbers.

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,115
" But the souls of the virtuous
are in the hands of God.

286
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,629
No torment shall ever touch them.

287
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,558
In the eyes of the unwise, they did
appear to die, but they are at peace.

288
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,314
But though in the sight of others
they were punished...

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,391
...their hope is full of immortality. "

290
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,476
-Your car won't start.
-Y es.

291
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,433
-What's wrong with it?
-The starter motor or the fan belt.

292
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,318
-Do you know anything about cars?
-No.

293
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,552
-Then how do you know--?
-Those are the two things I've heard of.

294
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,475
You fix your car
and pretend you' re not Iistening.

295
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,069
I'm gonna stand here and talk,
because I know you are.

296
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,959
-What could you possibly want?
-I've got numbers.

297
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,832
There's something abnormal about you.

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,673
FIorence Chadwick's been in the
English Department 1 3 years.

299
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,955
She makes $5900 a year.

300
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,590
Mr. Hopkins has been here
four years fewer and makes $7100.

301
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,911
-Is this the best time for this?
-You don't seem to be going anywhere.

302
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,433
A female cook makes $3200...

303
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,916
...compared to a male electrician
who makes $3900.

304
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,078
Where there is hatred, Iet us sow Iove.

305
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,635
Where there is injury, harmony.

306
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,039
And where there is doubt,
Iet there be faith in you. Amen.

307
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,672
The chaplain makes $4100.
The nurse makes $3100.

308
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,634
Miss Mueller gets paid an additional $200
a year to conduct the choir and band.

309
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,355
While Mr. Ryan gets paid an additional
$400 a year to coach the rowing team.

310
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,913
-Crew.
-What?

311
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,633
It's not rowing, it's crew.

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,717
FIorence is married with no dependents...

313
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,155
...and Mr. Hopkins
has a family of four to support.

314
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,709
If we paid people according
to how many children they had...

315
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,792
... Malcolm the groundskeeper would
get triple what the headmaster gets.

316
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,236
You know I'm right.
You've known it since I brought it up.

317
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,119
-What do you want me to do?
-Bring it up with your father.

318
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,949
-I'm not a woman, and I don't work here.
-The women who do are afraid.

319
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,353
If they bring it up, they' re afraid
for their jobs. What are you afraid of?

320
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,033
Why do you talk to me Iike this?

321
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,555
Because you never had a big sister
and you need one.

322
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,113
Look at you. You're a boy king.

323
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,154
You're a foot smarter
than the smartest kids in the class.

324
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,392
You're blessed with inspiration.
You must know this by now.

325
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,754
You must have sensed it.

326
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,712
Look...

327
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,233
...if you think we'rewrong,
if you think Mr. Hopkins...

328
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,149
...should honestly get paid more
than Mrs. Chadwick, then I respect that.

329
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,392
But if you think we'reright...

330
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,114
...and you won't speak up
because you can't be bothered...

331
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,350
...then God, Jed,
I don't even want to know you.

332
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,193
Come inside. I'II call AAA.

333
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,515
Miss Mueller gets half as much to teach
music as Ryan gets to coach crew?

334
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,239
You're gonna do it.

335
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,152
-I didn't say that.
-Y es, you did.

336
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,517
You stuck your hands in your
pockets, you Iooked away and smiled.

337
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,236
-You made up your mind.
-That doe'sn't mean--

338
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,311
-Y es, it doe's.
-I stuck my hands in my pockets.

339
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,313
And Iooked away and smiled.

340
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,112
We're in.

341
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,757
It was a beautiful service, I thought.

342
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,271
-I thought it was a beautiful service.
-Yeah.

343
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,159
She was a real dame, old friend.
A real broad.

344
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,998
Y eah.

345
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,508
-We've gotta go to the office now, sir.
-Y eah.

346
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,473
We've got some decisions to make now.

347
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,989
-Leo, would you do me a favor?
-Y eah.

348
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,079
Would you ask the agents
to seal the cathedral for a minute?

349
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,952
Y eah.

350
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,073
You're a son of a bitch, you know that?

351
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,356
She bought her first new car and you
hit her with a drunk driver. What?

352
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,835
Was that supposed to be funny?

353
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,390
"You can't conceive, nor can I,
the appalling strangeness...

354
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,990
...of the mercy of God, "
says Graham Greene.

355
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,549
I don't know whose ass
he was kissing there...

356
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,558
... because I think you' re just vindictive.

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,310
What was Josh Lyman, a warning shot?

358
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,390
That was my son.

359
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,116
What did I ever do to yours,
but praise his glory and praise his name?

360
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,792
There's a tropical storm
that's gaining speed and power.

361
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,875
We haven't had a storm this
bad since you took out...

362
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,638
...that tender ship of mine in the
North Atlantic Iast year, 68 crew.

363
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,670
You know what a tender ship doe's?
It fixes the other ships.

364
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,270
It doe'sn't even carry guns. It just goes
around and fixes the other ships...

365
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,278
...and delivers the mail.
That's all it can do.

366
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,955
Y es, I Iied. It was a sin.
I've committed many sins.

367
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,958
Have I displeased you,
you feckless thug?

368
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,755
3.8 million new jobs,
that wasn't good?

369
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,834
Bailed out Mexico.
Increased foreign trade.

370
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,918
Thirty million new acres of Iand
for conservation.

371
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,633
Put Mendoza on the bench.

372
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,150
We're not fighting a war.
I've raised three children.

373
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,875
That's not enough to buy me out
of the doghouse?

374
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,235
You get Hoynes.

375
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,152
-We'II call them answer A and answer B.
-Y eah.

376
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,392
" Mr. President, doe's this mean
you won't be seeking a second term? "

377
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,717
Answer A is, "You bet, I will absolutely
be seeking a second term.

378
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,390
I'm Iooking forward to the campaign.
There is great work yet to be done. "

379
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,113
-Y es.
-Answer B....

380
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,550
"Are you out of your mind?
I can't win re-election.

381
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,275
I Iied about a degenerative illness. I'm
the target of a grand jury investigation...

382
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,715
...and Congress is about
to take me out to Iunch.

383
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,633
I'd sooner have my family take their
clothes off and dance...

384
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,031
...on the T ruman Balcony than
campaign with this around my neck. "

385
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,114
-You think that's too on the nose?
-I do.

386
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,632
-I want to bring it up again.
-Why?

387
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,757
Because I got shouted down
three times...

388
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,388
...and I work here just Iike you do.
Can I help you?

389
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,552
Sorry.

390
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,754
I think we have to explore ways
of calling this off.

391
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,036
-Sam--
-It might be a mistake to send him on...

392
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,316
...at a moment when
we'retrying to demonstrate--

393
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,311
We don't know what
they' re talking about!

394
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,277
We don't know whether
he's running or not!

395
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,308
There are no ways. The story's Ieaked.
It's out there, we'redoing this.

396
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,636
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

397
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,752
They' re Iighting him
from outside the window.

398
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,913
Toby.

399
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,712
I have a meeting, believe it or not...

400
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
...with Greg Summerhays
for reasons passing understanding.

401
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,913
-Hello
-Toby.

402
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,315
-It's good to see you.
-How are you, Greg?

403
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,114
I was sorry about
the president's secretary.

404
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,072
-Thank you.
-Did you know her well?

405
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,675
Y eah.

406
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,677
-Let me get to why I'm here. I want to--
-You want to buy Atlantic Intermedia.

407
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,355
-Y eah.
-Greg, there's a reason the FCC--

408
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,632
-I'm not here about the FCC.
-Why are you here?

409
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,908
I'm Iaunching a 24-hour
cable news channel.

410
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,315
And I'm building it to compete.

411
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,593
And I'd Iike you to be the news director.

412
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,032
Okay.

413
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,353
Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.

414
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,715
-It was a nice service, don't you think?
-Y eah. Yeah, it was.

415
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,514
I'm gonna run across the street
to the OEOB for a minute.

416
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,075
The president's still after
information on the storm.

417
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,397
-I'm not sure why he's got it in his teeth.
-Yeah.

418
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,198
Josh, can this really be how it works?
We have no idea if he's gonna run.

419
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,675
He's in a room with Leo
making a decision.

420
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,757
Two people in a matter of minutes?

421
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,873
-This is how it works?
-This is how it works today.

422
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,031
Josh Lyman.

423
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,957
It's Leo.

424
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,032
-Hey, Toby.
-Don't anybody talk to me right now.

425
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,511
Josh, Greg Summerhays
was here to offer me a job.

426
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,871
Leo got me a Iifeboat. I'm gonna rip
his arms off, and beat him--

427
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,072
Toby, that was Leo.
He wants us over there.

428
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,510
It's answer B.

429
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,835
With the president and first lady
having just concluded the interview...

430
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,996
...President Bartlet is expected
to be arriving...

431
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,430
... at the State Department
for a press conference.

432
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,319
Typically, a press conference,
particularly of this size...

433
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,948
... would be held in the East Room
of the White House...

434
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,590
... but we 're told there are some repairs
going on and so the change of venue.

435
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,513
Chris Watson, can you tell us what we
might expect to hear...

436
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,750
... from the president in a few minutes?

437
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,077
Wait, all right. Our apologies,
we 'll have Chris in a moment.

438
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,999
Why don' t you sit in here
for a few minutes.

439
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,674
I ' m gonna get C.J.
You two do a Iast-minute review.

440
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,110
-I'm fine.
-I'm gonna get C.J.

441
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,709
-Y eah.
-Sit here.

442
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,480
CIose your eyes a few minutes.

443
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,429
-Charlie will get you when we'reready.
-Y eah.

444
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,317
A couple of years ago
I began experiencing...

445
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,670
...blurred vision
and numbness in my legs.

446
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,950
Two years and many tests later...

447
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,398
...I was diagnosed with a course
of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

448
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,353
That startling admission
made just moments ago from--

449
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,595
-Toby.
-Y eah.

450
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,395
-Where' s C.J.?
-She ran back to her office.

451
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,030
They' re gonna run this clip forever.

452
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,754
No, we'reabout to give them
clips to beat it.

453
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,634
Leo, you got me a Iifeboat?

454
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,759
-Greg Summerhays.
-Y eah.

455
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,273
Yeah, I got you a Iifeboat.

456
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,515
Did you imagine that there
were any circumstances...

457
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,636
... under which I would use it?

458
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,238
-No.
-Then why?

459
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,997
T o show him that.

460
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,074
C.J. 's in her office?

461
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,113
You think he's gonna
change his mind, don't you?

462
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,235
You think he's gonna run.

463
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,434
C.J. 's in her office?

464
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,798
Yeah.

465
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,957
Yeah.

466
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,632
-You wanted to see Donna Moss?
-Yeah.

467
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,519
-Good evening, sir.
-How are you?

468
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,636
Fine, sir.
We all thought you did very well.

469
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,553
-That was the easy part.
-It didn't Iook that easy.

470
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,069
T alk about the weather.

471
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,711
A tropical storm is a cyclone in which
the maximum sustained surface speed...

472
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,751
...of the wind is 34
nautical miles per hour.

473
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,192
-There's a tropical storm season, right?
-Y es, it's June 1 to November 30.

474
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,036
Okay. And how many times,
say, in the Iast 100 years...

475
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,953
... has a tropical storm
come up the Atlantic seaboard...

476
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,878
...to Washington in the middle of May?

477
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,799
According to the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration...

478
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,951
-...it hasn't happened in a century.
-At all?

479
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,189
No, sir.

480
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,518
Y eah?

481
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,032
-Excuse me, sir.
-Y eah. Thanks, Donna.

482
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,635
Thank you, Mr. President.

483
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,430
According to the NOAA, the storm
is a nonrecurring phenomenon...

484
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,677
...which is science's term for,
"We don't know what's going on...

485
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,434
... but we'restocking up
on canned goods. "

486
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,477
I just wanted to review a few things.

487
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,029
Stuff you don't think
I'd remember from an hour ago?

488
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,509
Take the first question
from Lawrence AItman...

489
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,597
... The Times
chief medical correspondent.

490
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,273
-Why?
-If you call on anyone else...

491
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,431
...the first question
will be about re-election.

492
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,876
Calling AItman, it will be a medical
question and he'II have follow-ups.

493
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,874
It'II allow you to feel comfortable
before you start with the political mess.

494
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,830
AItman will be in the front row,
first seat on your right.

495
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,148
-Mr. President?
-Yeah?

496
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,998
-Where's AItman gonna be?
-C.J. --

497
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,197
I'm going there right now.
This is the Iast time I'm gonna see you.

498
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,510
-PIease--
-Front row, first seat on the right.

499
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,557
Whose right?

500
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,199
My right.

501
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,391
Thank you, sir.

502
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,472
Come in.

503
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,429
" If you hide your ignorance, no one
will hit you and you'II never Iearn. "

504
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,596
Is this your quote?

505
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,190
Dad, I wanted to mention something
to you regarding salary equity.

506
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,674
Is this your quote?

507
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,634
" If you hide your ignorance, no one
will hit you and you'II never Iearn. "

508
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,199
It's actually Ray Bradbury.

509
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,556
-And you quoted Ray Bradbury?
-Y es.

510
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,036
In an article you and your friends
wrote condemning Professor Loomis.

511
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,748
For banning certain books
from the Iibrary.

512
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,593
-He's a professor of Iiterature.
-He banned Henry Miller...

513
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,069
... D. H. Lawrence and
Giovanni's Room. It's too homosexual.

514
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,276
Stop it.
You're a guest at this school.

515
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,149
I'm a student. He banned Fahrenheit 45 1,
which is about banning books.

516
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,595
Was that supposed to be funny?

517
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,759
That wordplay that you just did,
was that meant to be funny?

518
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,558
No, that was supposed--

519
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,319
Was there anything else?

520
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,471
-It's not a nondenominational service.
-Don't start with this.

521
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,439
Catholics don't believe man is saved
through faith alone.

522
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,835
Catholics believe faith
has to be joined with good works.

523
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,156
You're the only one
who minds the service.

524
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,239
-I'm the only one who's Catholic.
-You're Catholic because...

525
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,597
...your mother is and you' re at this
school because I'm the headmaster.

526
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,758
How's that for clever with words?

527
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,355
Now, what was it
you came in here to talk to me about?

528
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,679
Nothing.

529
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,279
PIease close the door behind you.

530
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,198
Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!

531
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,913
I really wish you wouldn't shout,
Mr. President.

532
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,278
The door keeps blowing open.

533
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,359
Y es, but there's an intercom, and
you could use it to call me at my desk.

534
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,790
-I was--
-You don't know how to use it.

535
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,398
It's not that I don't know how to use it.
It's just that I haven't Iearned yet.

536
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,632
I have MS, and I didn't tell anybody.

537
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,358
Yeah.

538
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,312
-So you' re having a Iittle bit of a day.
-You gonna make jokes?

539
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,028
God doe'sn't make cars crash
and you know it.

540
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,754
Stop using me as an excuse.

541
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,911
The party's not gonna want me to run.

542
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,350
The party will come back.
You'II get them back.

543
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,194
I got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham.

544
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,154
I've never been the most popular guy
in the Democratic Party.

545
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,473
I've got a secret for you, Mr. President.

546
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,069
Your father was a prick who never
got over the fact...

547
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,151
...that he wasn't as smart
as his brothers.

548
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,440
Are you in a tough spot? Y es.
Do I feel sorry for you? I do not.

549
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,599
Why? Because there are people
way worse off than you.

550
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,996
Give me numbers.

551
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,629
I don't know numbers.
You give them to me.

552
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,517
How about a child born in this minute...

553
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,632
... has a one-in-five chance
in being born into poverty.

554
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,432
How many Americans
Iack health insurance?

555
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,555
Forty-four million.

556
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,479
What's the number one cause of death
for black men under 35?

557
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,715
Homicide.

558
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,797
-How many Americans are behind bars?
-Three million.

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,956
-How many Americans are addicts?
-Five million.

560
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,510
-And one in five kids in poverty?
-That's 1 3 million American children.

561
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,189
Three and a half million kids go to
schools that are Iiterally falling apart.

562
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,437
We need 1 27 billion
in school construction...

563
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,153
...and we need it today.

564
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,915
T o say nothing of 53 people
trapped in an embassy.

565
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,957
Yes.

566
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,589
You know, if you don't want
to run again, I respect that.

567
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,112
But if you don't run because you think
it's gonna be too hard...

568
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,998
...or you think you' re gonna Iose...

569
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,476
...well, God, Jed,
I don't even wanna know you.

570
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,271
Mr. President?

571
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,431
Mr. President, it's time.

572
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,913
And he'II be speaking to that
just as soon as he gets here.

573
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,479
Frank, then Leslie.

574
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,719
Has there been any discussion
of a special prosecutor?

575
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,992
T omorrow morning the president
will direct the attorney general...

576
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,957
...to appoint a special prosecutor, yes.

577
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,792
I can't see. Joan.

578
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,915
A Iist of three prosecutors
is given to a three-judge panel.

579
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,190
The prosecutors, as well as the judges...

580
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,755
...were all appointed
by Republican presidents.

581
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,557
PIease, I can only answer 1 4 or 1 5
questions at once. Hal.

582
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,834
I can't comment on a witness Iist
that doe'sn't exist...

583
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,036
... but I imagine subpoenas
will be issued...

584
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,118
...to most senior White House staff,
including myself.

585
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,875
Again, I can't comment on what kind
of hearings Congress has in mind.

586
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,237
I'm sure there'II be one,
but you'd have to talk to Congress.

587
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,150
Okay. Here now,
the president of the United States.

588
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,394
Front row on your right.

589
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,952
