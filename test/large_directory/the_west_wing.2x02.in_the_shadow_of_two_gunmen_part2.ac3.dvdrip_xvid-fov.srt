Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,777
Mr. President?

3
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,455
GW, move, move!

4
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:18,060
Josh, didn't you hear me shouting
for you? I need a doctor.

5
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:21,540
-His pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
-I need to get to New Hampshire.

6
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:25,539
Come to Nashua, New Hampshire,
Thursday and hear Jed Bartlet speak.

7
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:26,899
I work for Hoynes.

8
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:29,534
-Come to Nashua Thursday night.
-Why?

9
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:32,379
That's what sons do for old
friends of their father's.

10
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,098
If I see the real thing,
should I tell you?

11
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:35,939
-You won't have to.
-Why?

12
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,383
-You got a bad poker face.
-Two shooters.

13
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,225
We got them,
but there was a signal.

14
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,580
-There was somebody on the ground?
-White male. 20, 25, maybe 5'10".

15
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,467
Deputy White House chief
of staff, Joshua Lyman...

16
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:08,463
...is currently undergoing extensive
surgery to repair a collapsed lung...

17
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:12,103
...and to remove a bullet that remains
lodged in his thoracic region.

18
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:15,187
For an update on his condition,
let's go live to Lynn Blakley...

19
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:19,548
... who 's standing by
at George Washington Hospital.

20
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:22,191
Wait, we 're not going there just yet.

21
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:28,586
Now, I'm being told that authorities
are reporting another gunshot victim....

22
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,671
-FBl.
-Let me see those hands!

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,479
-Police.
-Hold it right there.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,192
-Get down.
-Police. Right there.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,196
-Police. Freeze!
-Throw those hands up.

26
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,517
-Get down on the ground now!
-Get down.

27
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,440
-Secret Service.
-I said, get down, now!

28
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:58,360
Don't move.

29
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:48,524
We're confirming now that a suspect
has been taken into custody...

30
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:51,082
...and is being questioned
by federal law enforcement.

31
00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:52,569
At this time, we cannot...

32
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:56,489
...we are not releasing any information
whatsoever about the suspect.

33
00:02:56,575 --> 00:03:00,455
C.J., can you tell us anything?
His name, where he's from, ethnicity...

34
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,493
...if you guys suspect a motive?

35
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,215
I can tell you all those things...

36
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:07,058
... because when I said we weren't
releasing information...

37
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:10,774
... I meant, except his name, his address,
and what we think his motive was.

38
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,256
I am releasing the name
of Stephanie Abbott.

39
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,328
A-B-B-O-T-T,
of Silver Spring, Maryland...

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,216
...who was in the crowd and sustained
an injury to the left femur...

41
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,651
...which is the thigh bone.

42
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:28,292
The president remains in stable
condition in the recovery room...

43
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,734
...and is expected to be released
some time Wednesday.

44
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:35,380
Josh Lyman is now in his
sixth hour of surgery...

45
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:40,574
... to repair a collapsed lung and
a ruptured pulmonary artery.

46
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:44,939
We won 't have an update on him
until the procedure is complete...

47
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:49,265
... which they expect won 't be
for another six or eight hours.

48
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,539
We 'll keep you updated in the
next hour. Thank you very much.

49
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,979
C.J., what about the conference?

50
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,468
Ma'am, doe's the president
know they've arrested a suspect?

51
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,066
Yes, I told him. He's pretty groggy
after the anesthesia.

52
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,946
Sam, Toby, you've got a
phone call in the other room.

53
00:04:18,473 --> 00:04:20,304
Donna?

54
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,068
You wanna throw some water
on your face?

55
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:30,671
I should ask, is there anything
I'm supposed to be doing right now?

56
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,714
-No.
-Anything that Josh's office should do?

57
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:37,626
-Should I make sure it's farmed out?
-No. I'm sure it's covered.

58
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,678
-You got them on the phone?
-Yes.

59
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,680
-Guys?
-Yeah, we're here.

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,275
Sam, I need you to come here and
speak to Nancy McNally about a letter...

61
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,593
... the president was supposed to sign.
She 'll know what you mean.

62
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,520
-And, Toby?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,477
-They' re still asking about the tent.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:08,555
I'm comfortable with a " no comment"
from the Secret Service.

65
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:09,553
What's this?

66
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,802
They wanna know why the president
exited the building in open air.

67
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:15,234
-I'll talk to somebody at T reasury.
-I'll do it.

68
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:16,759
-Let me.
-Someone.

69
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:18,484
We're in the meeting together.

70
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:22,605
-Let's go back to the office.
-Okay. Okay.

71
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:26,966
Can the ships pass inspection?

72
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,604
They'll register in Libya and Panama
so they aren't subject to the OPA...

73
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,277
...which wouldn't allow an
American company to keep it.

74
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,479
I think 20-1 7.

75
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,521
I think 20-1 5. You get the idea.

76
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,324
I think all that's left then
is to dot the T's.

77
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,603
Actually, I have a thing.
I have a thing I was gonna mention.

78
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,489
Just a proposal to throw out there.

79
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,692
When I was a congressional aide,
we had an expression:

80
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,968
" No idea was too stupid to say
out loud. " So here it is. Bear me out.

81
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,325
Instead of buying the ships,
don't buy these ships.

82
00:05:56,653 --> 00:06:00,647
Buy other ships. Buy better ships.
That's my idea.

83
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,413
What's he talking about?

84
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,533
That's a perfectly fair question.
Sam, what are you talking about?

85
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:09,087
And we have a no-penalty clause
if we pull out before December 1.

86
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,011
But, Sam, we want these ships. This is
as little as we've ever paid for a fleet.

87
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,009
There's a reason they
don't cost a lot.

88
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:18,290
They' re 20-year-old, single-hulled
VLCC's that nobody else wants.

89
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,127
They'll hit things and break, because they
don't have good navigation systems.

90
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,774
They don't have G3 tank gauging,
EM-5000 monitoring...

91
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,414
...the recommended
electropneumatic ballast.

92
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,891
And yesterday he didn't know the
difference between a ship and boat.

93
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,331
You told us you covered our liability.

94
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,733
Strictly speaking, I did, but there's
a broader liability to consider.

95
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,537
-People drove past Exxon after Valdez.
-We've got PR firms for PR problems.

96
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,735
There's a Suez tanker ready to launch
at Koje lsland in Korea.

97
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:46,822
Chevron dropped the option,
and it's in the cradle.

98
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:49,100
Sam, could I talk to you for a second?

99
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:52,695
308,000 dead weight tons,
carries 2.2 million gallons.

100
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:55,663
-You can have it for 46 million.
-46 million dollars?

101
00:06:55,785 --> 00:07:00,143
-That's a good price.
-Sam, what are you doing?

102
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,622
-I think I have an obligation--
-What are you doing?

103
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,216
Maybe they want
to buy safer boats.

104
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:06,543
Are you trying to get fired?

105
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,625
Maybe they'll thank
us for the suggestion.

106
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:09,977
Knock it off, Sam.

107
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,578
-Look--
-Knock it off.

108
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,343
I'm looking-- Operator, I'm looking for
the number of a law firm in Manhattan.

109
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:24,020
Here's the thing, I can't remember
the name of the firm.

110
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,461
No, wait, wait, wait!

111
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:29,506
I just came back from New Hampshire
where I saw this guy and I have to--

112
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:33,427
Listen, it's a very famous firm
that handled Shearson...

113
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:38,589
...you must know, okay.
You know what, I'm just-- Okay. Bye.

114
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,707
-That's advertised over--
-1 5 years.

115
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,071
-Pretax?
-Sam?

116
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,075
Fifteen-year pretax amortization?

117
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,235
-Eleven million extra.
-Oh, God.

118
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:53,149
-This again?
-The money will be spent.

119
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,633
You can spend it now or later,
but it's cheaper now.

120
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,311
-Sam?
-It's the right thing.

121
00:07:57,638 --> 00:07:59,630
Spend 1 1 million extra
on a better boat.

122
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,635
The Amoco Cadiz. 68 million gallons
of crude oil off Brittany, France.

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,996
Braer, a Liberian tanker, 26 million
gallons off the Shetland lslands.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,036
The Exxon Valdez, the Aegean Sea,
the Argo Merchant. Look it up.

125
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,841
-They' re aware--
-Spend 1 1 million.

126
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,481
-Enough.
-You don't wanna pay?

127
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,797
Pass the expense to us.

128
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:20,280
Half a penny at the tank. Here's 5
bucks, 1000 people are on me.

129
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,241
Sam.

130
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,636
Sam, we are in the
middle of a meeting.

131
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:31,762
Sam, we're not indifferent to the
concerns for the environmentalist.

132
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:34,881
-Excuse me, Sam?
-Yeah.

133
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:38,643
It doe'sn't quite feel like
I have your attention.

134
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:41,045
Yeah.

135
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,846
Yeah.

136
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,958
Yeah. I'm not gonna need that.

137
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,407
Sam? Sam?
Sam, please keep your seat.

138
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,807
-Sam, where are you going?
-New Hampshire.

139
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,285
If you'll just follow me.

140
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:10,690
-Sam.
-Yeah.

141
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,646
-I wanted to see if--
-How's your head?

142
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,324
Fine. I wanted to see if
you talked to Nancy McNally.

143
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,207
Yeah. She talked to counsel's office.

144
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,730
They'll work on some things.
We're not gonna like it.

145
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:22,490
You didn't notice,
when the shooting started...

146
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:25,655
...you didn't happen to notice who
pulled me to the ground, did you?

147
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:26,847
No.

148
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:30,767
They pulled me down behind a police
car and my necklace came off.

149
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,296
You talked to Nancy McNally?
Okay.

150
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:34,489
-C.J.
-Yeah?

151
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,088
-Call Debbie at The Today Show.
-Why?

152
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,610
We said you'd do the
morning shows at 7.

153
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,610
That's not a good--

154
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,334
No, I'm not gonna do any
interviews yet. I'm not.

155
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,531
I'll take care of it.

156
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:45,895
-Who said--?
-It's a mistake.

157
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,610
-C.J.?
-Yeah.

158
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,096
I don't wanna be this guy.

159
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,338
Someone thought I should
do morning shows.

160
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:53,294
-I have no answer.
-Who was in charge?

161
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,893
For the three and a half hours
the president was under anesthesia.

162
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:59,459
Danny, it's a little complicated.

163
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:05,098
There's the National Security Act
of 1947, there's the 25th....

164
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:08,662
Nancy McNally, Bill Hutchinson,
the White House Council, they' re on it.

165
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:11,221
They'll tell me who was
supposed to be in charge.

166
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,264
I wanna know who was in charge.

167
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,425
And we are working on that information.

168
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,064
We're working on it.

169
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,709
Hello?

170
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,384
Yeah?

171
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,945
Isobel, it's 6:30 in the morning.

172
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,386
Yeah.

173
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,715
Excuse me. C.J.'s here.

174
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,749
Thank you.

175
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,114
Good morning, lsobel.
Hello, Roger.

176
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,309
I asked her to be here 45 minutes ago.

177
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,634
-I'm sorry?
-I said, I asked you to be--

178
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,630
-Roger.
-lt was 6:30 in the morning.

179
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,316
I wasn't quite ready for work.
But I am now, how can I help you?

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,675
Are you aware that the Golden Globe
nominations were announced today?

181
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,033
I wasn't.

182
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:28,272
-Am I up for something?
-Atlantis only got two nominations.

183
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,602
For the entire studio. Best comedy
score and supporting actor for the kid.

184
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:34,681
That's what 20,000
a month bought us.

185
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:38,240
Roger, I think we put together
a very aggressive campaign.

186
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:41,683
-Two nominations.
-That's two more than a lot of people.

187
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:45,845
Are you aware that the new Premiere
magazine list is coming out Monday?

188
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,043
The 100 most powerful
people in Hollywood.

189
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,516
-Yeah.
-Yes, I am.

190
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,160
I can tell you that you' re on it.

191
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:55,686
Congratulations. It must, you know,
feel good being that powerful.

192
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,398
I went from third to ninth.
I dropped to ninth.

193
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:02,238
Do you know how that looks? Do you
know how many were ahead of me?

194
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,764
-Eight?
-Lady, you' re--

195
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,727
The movies were bad, Roger.
All of them.

196
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,684
Even the little kid was bad,
but he was a little kid.

197
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,610
He had a couple of scenes,
big eyeglasses, little lisp.

198
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:13,523
He's going to the Golden Globes.

199
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:17,167
Know why the New Coke campaign
failed? Nobody liked New Coke.

200
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,603
The movies were bad.
If the movies were unknown...

201
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:24,046
...I could help you, but they weren't.
They were just bad.

202
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:29,329
Roger, would you excuse us
for just a second, please.

203
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,848
Sorry I talked to him like that...

204
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:37,605
...but do you think he had
The Maltese Falcon out there?

205
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:41,447
The thing is, C.J.,
he's big business for me.

206
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,417
I'll apologize to him, lsobel.

207
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,771
I'll find someone to make him
man of the year.

208
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,656
I'll ask around in Vegas.

209
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,573
He wants you fired.
He thinks you're a smart mouth.

210
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,338
He's gonna pull his business
unless you fire me?

211
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,930
This is never what you
wanted to be doing, C.J.

212
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,690
-You've always felt it was beneath you.
-lt is.

213
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:04,691
Take me off film and television.
I don't know anything about it, anyway.

214
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:09,778
I need to keep his business.
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,699
-You're firing me?
-I'm sorry.

216
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,662
-Out here in the hallway?
-C.J....

217
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:19,904
-I need someone to call me a cab.
-I'm sorry?

218
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:24,624
I couldn't get my contacts in and I broke
my glasses getting out of the car.

219
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:28,780
I can't drive myself home.
I need someone to call me a cab.

220
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:33,298
Could you call a taxi for C.J., please?

221
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,223
I have to go back in.

222
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,300
It was a bad movie, lsobel.

223
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,026
Yes, I need a taxi for
Beverly Hills, please.

224
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:15,073
-Hello.
-Hey, C.J.

225
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,073
-Who is that?
-It's me.

226
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,034
-Toby?
-Yeah.

227
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,271
What the hell are you--? Ah!

228
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,792
C.J., you fell into the pool there.

229
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,441
I can't see.

230
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:39,311
Yeah. Well, maybe kind of try and feel
your way to dry land. You want a hand?

231
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,793
Shut up.

232
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,192
-Avert your eyes.
-What?

233
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:51,718
I'm climbing out of the pool,
my clothes will cling. Avert your eyes.

234
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,276
-C.J., I didn't come here--
-Avert your eyes.

235
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,164
Okay.

236
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,404
Oh, turn around.

237
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:13,328
I tried calling you at your office. They
said you were fired. Were you stealing?

238
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:16,682
Roger Becker dropped from third
most powerful person in Hollywood...

239
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,245
...to ninth most powerful
person in Hollywood.

240
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:23,809
-Doe's he still make the playoffs?
-They take it seriously.

241
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:27,965
C.J., Jed Bartlet's
very impressed with you.

242
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:32,931
He likes the work you did with that
girl's group with the stupid name.

243
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,168
-Emily's List?
-Yes.

244
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:37,331
That girl's group with the stupid name?

245
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,566
Emily's List. Early Money
is Like Yeast.

246
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,208
-lt helps raise dough.
-I get it.

247
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,173
They raise money
for women candidates.

248
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:46,971
Early Money is Like Yeast,
it helps raise the dough...

249
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:49,327
-...for the candidates.
-I really do get it.

250
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:52,092
-Bartlet's impressed with me?
-Very impressed.

251
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:56,451
One of the big keys to his game plan
is bringing you on as press secretary.

252
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,417
-He's never heard of me, has he?
-No.

253
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,498
-Toby....
-I'm here on behalf of Leo McGarry.

254
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,809
-McGarry wants me?
-Yes. Come join the campaign.

255
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,093
-How much?
-How much were you making before?

256
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,572
-$550,000 a year.
-This pays $600 a week.

257
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,933
-So this is less?
-Yes.

258
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:23,097
Toby, doe's he know I've
only ever worked statewide?

259
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,659
Doe's he know I've never worked
on a national campaign?

260
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:29,898
Yes. It's graduation day.

261
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,221
You really think I can do this?

262
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:36,660
Yeah.

263
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,784
-ls Jed Bartlet a good man?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,104
Toby?

265
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,426
Yes.

266
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,499
Let's go in so I can change my
clothes and we'll talk about it.

267
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,779
-C.J.?
-Yeah.

268
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,268
-The house is over there.
-Okay.

269
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,662
One of them was using a 9mm Beretta,
the other had a.357 Desert Eagle.

270
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,586
Ron's saying that these were
the wrong weapons to use...

271
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,147
...for a shooting of this kind.

272
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,186
That's why the injury count
was so low.

273
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,664
We don't know what
the injury count is yet.

274
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:15,263
Yeah, but his point is....

275
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:19,754
-Excuse me, sir. You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

276
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:29,072
Charlie, the guy the Secret Service
have in custody is named Carl Leroy.

277
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,670
He gives a statement in which he says
that he and the shooters...

278
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:37,230
...were members of an organization
called West Virginia White Pride.

279
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,354
They tried to kill the president
because Zoey and I are together?

280
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,518
No.

281
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,992
-Why, then?
-Charlie...

282
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,671
...the president wasn't the target.

283
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:53,756
According to the statement,
the president wasn't the target.

284
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,875
Okay.

285
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,761
Okay, well....

286
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,758
Okay.

287
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,802
Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,446
-Dad, I'm gonna....
-Go.

289
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,200
We don't know what
the injury count is yet.

290
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:42,166
He was supposed to sign a letter?

291
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:45,402
If the president is going
under general anesthesia...

292
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:49,283
...he usually signs a letter handing over
executive powers to the vice president.

293
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,209
And the president didn't sign a letter?

294
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,886
-Nope, we blew that play.
-ls there gonna be trouble?

295
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,693
We'll see. T o be honest with you,
I don't really care right now.

296
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:04,614
Can I just say something?
You know, for the future?

297
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,410
Yeah.

298
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:11,529
I can sign the president's name.
I have his signature down pretty good.

299
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,009
-You can sign the president's name?
-Yeah.

300
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,616
On a document removing him from
power and handing it to someone else?

301
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,254
Yeah.

302
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:24,019
Do you think the White House counsel
would say that was a bad idea?

303
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:27,652
I think the White House counsel
would say that's a coup d'état.

304
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:31,133
-I'd probably end up doing time.
-I would think.

305
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,661
And what the hell are you doing
practicing the president's signature?

306
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:37,019
-Just for fun.
-We've got separation of powers...

307
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:40,900
...checks and balances, and Margaret,
vetoing things and sending them back.

308
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,977
Who wanted me to do
the morning shows?

309
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,262
-I did.
-Why?

310
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,458
The president's not
ready for cameras...

311
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:50,944
...if it's the vice president, it'll look
like we don't have a president...

312
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:53,025
...and it's time the White House
comes out.

313
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,458
-I think it's a bad idea.
-Why?

314
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,626
I just....

315
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,707
First of all, I think it's inappropriate
while Josh-- You know, until....

316
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,982
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

317
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,860
-C.J.
-Nothing.

318
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,225
I'd rather not,
but obviously--

319
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,710
-Have Sam do it.
-Okay.

320
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,181
Listen, the letter....

321
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,026
-The three and a half hours?
-Yeah.

322
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,589
I don't know how long
I can dance around Danny...

323
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,711
...and it'll be Danny times
100 by lunch.

324
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,022
-Have him come see me.
-Yeah?

325
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,027
-Yeah.
-Okay.

326
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:29,393
She doe'sn't want to do
the morning shows.

327
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:33,305
She's been getting questions about
why the president exited in open air.

328
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:37,749
They remember that the Secret Service
used to construct a tent or a canopy.

329
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,751
-I'm gonna talk to Ron Butterfield.
-They don't comment on procedure.

330
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,954
I know, but maybe
I can talk him out of it.

331
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:46,036
I should try anyway.

332
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,868
-You don't have to, Toby.
-Yeah. I should, though.

333
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,757
Okay.

334
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,879
--won the straw poll,
pulling in 48 percent of the vote.

335
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,840
Senator William Wiley drew a poorer
than expected 22 percent...

336
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:06,637
... but the story this morning
is the 1 9 percent...

337
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,484
... picked up by former New
Hampshire governor, Jed Bartlet...

338
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,961
...who leapfrogged several Democrats
to finish a surprising third.

339
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:16,874
And we'regonna go now to Governor
Bartlet who's standing by live....

340
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:21,324
I'm told we don't have the governor
at this moment, so while we try--

341
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:24,440
-Who can tell me what we did wrong?
-I blew it. What's next?

342
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,764
We didn't have the candidate.
Anybody who answered--

343
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,163
-What's next?
-Toby wants to say something.

344
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,803
-Which one is Toby?
-I am.

345
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:35,519
-And which one are you?
-I'm Josh.

346
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:38,608
-What is it you wanted to say?
-Let's get out of New Hampshire.

347
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,999
-Why?
-Nothing to win here.

348
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,200
He's right.

349
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,045
The New Hampshire primary
isn't held in New Hampshire?

350
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,760
-You can't win the primary.
-I'm gonna win the primary.

351
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,731
-Which is why you can't win it.
-You're popular here.

352
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:53,249
You're a Democrat, elected with 69
percent of the vote. That's unheard of.

353
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,650
All you can hope for
is an "as expected"...

354
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:00,165
...and there's the possibility
you can embarrass yourself.

355
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:02,525
-I appreciate that.
-Toby meant in the polls.

356
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,254
I know what he meant.

357
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:07,733
Hoynes will be in a fight with Wiley
for a second place finish here.

358
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,610
We'll be the only ones
in South Carolina.

359
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,734
We won't beat Hoynes
in South Carolina.

360
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:15,615
-We don't have to beat Hoynes.
-We just have to beat Wiley.

361
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:17,894
Wiley's gonna drop out
after South Carolina?

362
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:19,929
If he doe'sn't finish higher than third.

363
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:23,256
-Will we get his endorsement?
-We'll get his money, that's for sure.

364
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,092
-It's for sure?
-Josh thinks it is.

365
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:28,373
-Which one is Josh?
-I am.

366
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,730
Okay.

367
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,499
So we finish second in South Carolina,
we pick up some steam...

368
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,973
...endorsements, money going into
South Dakota, Vermont, Maine--

369
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:42,176
Where we get a split or better and
the prohibitive nominee...

370
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:46,013
-... has lost three of seven contests--
-Half the primaries.

371
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:48,494
Hoynes'll win the South,
we'll take the North.

372
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,538
-lt will be decided in lllinois.
-lllinois will be High Noon.

373
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:54,584
If we win in lllinois, we can
win California and New York?

374
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:57,301
If we win in lllinois,
we're gonna run the table.

375
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,546
That's it then. We've saved people
the trouble of voting. What's next?

376
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:04,222
-Our point is that it's--
-I understood the point.

377
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:07,018
We're going to South Carolina
to set up lllinois.

378
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:09,743
When I ask "what's next,"
it means I'm ready to move on.

379
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,257
So, what's next?

380
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,462
-We're done.
-Fantastic.

381
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,668
Well, I feel bathed in the warm
embrace of the candidate, Leo.

382
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:23,227
He's really very easy to like once
you get to know him.

383
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:26,902
-How many people get that far?
-Not that many.

384
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:27,868
Okay.

385
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:31,904
Josh Lyman. No, he's not
available right now.

386
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:36,147
This afternoon he's got a media session
and a 4:00 with finance.

387
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:39,068
If you leave your name,
I'll give Josh the message.

388
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:40,915
Thank you very much.

389
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:42,189
-Hi.
-Hi.

390
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:44,228
-Who are you?
-I'm Donna Moss. Who are you?

391
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:47,269
I'm Josh Lyman.
Ahh.
Yes.

392
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,872
-I'm your new assistant.
-Did I have an old assistant?

393
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:51,505
-Maybe not.
-Who are you?

394
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,232
I'm Donna Moss,
I came here to volunteer and the woman assigned me to you.

395
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,428
-Which woman?
-Betsy.

396
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,707
-You meen Margaret?
-Yes.

397
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,757
-Who are you?
-I'm Donna Moss, I'll be working as your assistant.

398
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,956
-I've got to talk to Margaret.
-Actually, Josh?

399
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,037
-When I said I was assigned to you?
-Yeah?

400
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,233
I may have been overstating it a little.

401
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:10,758
-Who are you?
-I'm Donna Moss, I drove here from Maddison Wisconsin.

402
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,839
When did your boyfriend
break up with you?

403
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,555
What makes you think my boyfriend broke up with me?

404
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:16,799
Well, you're too old for your parents
to have kicked you out of the house.

405
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,562
I'm here cause I wanna work for Bartlet.

406
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:21,199
I'm a college graduate with a degree
in political science and government.

407
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:25,113
Where did you graduate?
Haa?
Where did you graduate?

408
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:27,600
-Okay, when I said I graduated?
-Yeah?

409
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,762
-I may have overstated a little.
-Look--

410
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,996
-Look...
-I was a couple of credits short.
-From where?

411
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:35,084
-University of Wisconsin.
-And you majored in poli-sci and government?

412
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,722
And sociology and psychology.
Ahh,

413
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:40,447
And biology for a while.
With a minor in French.

414
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,719
-Okay.
-And drama.

415
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:45,687
You had five majors
and two minors in four years?

416
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:47,929
-Two years.
-OK, Listen--

417
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:49,647
I had to drop out.

418
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,326
-I had to drop out.
-Your boyfriend was older than you?

419
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,200
I think that question's a bit
of a personal nature.

420
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,288
You were at my desk,
reading my calendar...

421
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,723
...answering my phone and hoping
I wouldn't notice I never hired you.

422
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:03,325
-Your boyfriend was older?
-Yes.

423
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:04,807
-Law student.
-Medical student.

424
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:08,329
The idea was you'd drop out and pay
bills till he's done with his residency.

425
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,643
-Yes.
-And did you?
-Yes.

426
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:11,691
And why did Dr. Freeride
break up with you?

427
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,733
What makes you think
he broke up with me?

428
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:24,011
Donna, this is a campaign
for the presidency...

429
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:26,333
...and there's nothing
I take more seriously than that.

430
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:29,938
This can't be a place for people
to find confidence and start over.

431
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:32,771
-Why not?
-I'm sorry?

432
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:34,815
-Why can't it be those things?
-Because--

433
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,812
Is it gonna interfere with my typing?

434
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,255
Donna, we're picking up today
and going to South Carolina.

435
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,850
-lf you wanna stay in the Mancester office...
-I wanna come to Charleston.

436
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:46,093
I can't carry you. I've got a lot of
guys out there not making the trip.

437
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,140
-I'll pay my own way.
-With what?

438
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:51,460
I'll sleep on the floor, I'll sell my car and
Eventually you'll put me on salary.

439
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:53,779
-Donna--
-Look.

440
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:57,182
I think I can be good at this.

441
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:00,702
I think you might find me valuable.

442
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:08,939
Go ahead.

443
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:15,864
Bartlet for America,
Josh Lyman's office.

444
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:20,306
Yes. I think I'm gonna have
somebody from the press office...

445
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:23,103
...get back to you if it relates to....

446
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,259
Yes.
Ahh yes.

447
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,742
Yes.

448
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:34,823
Yes.

449
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:41,303
-Suction.
-Chest tube's clear.

450
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:46,827
Pressure's holding, 131/65.

451
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,472
-Hey, Spanky.
-Oh, God, what'd I do?

452
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,909
Take a walk with me, would you?

453
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,238
They're taking him off bypass now.

454
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,795
Yeah, I just heard.
I'm gonna head to the hospital.

455
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,078
-You did well on the morning shows.
-Thanks.

456
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:24,798
I told Leo I didn't want to do it
because Josh was in surgery.

457
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:28,871
-Yeah.
-You know what the real reason was?

458
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,562
-The real reason?
-Yeah.

459
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:33,358
-No.
-I think you do.

460
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:34,599
Listen, C.J.?

461
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,079
The real reason I couldn't
go on the morning shows...

462
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,960
...and give a first hand account of what happened
is, I couldn't remember what happened.

463
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:43,799
I remember walking out of the building.
I remember somebody knocked me down.

464
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,319
I know my necklace came off...

465
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:48,360
...and I know a police car
window exploded over my head.

466
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:51,639
All night long I've been doing briefings using
notes from other people's accounts.

467
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:53,968
But it's morning now
and I listened to you...

468
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,802
...on the morning shows
and I know what happened.

469
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,645
-C.J.--
-Sam, I think you have my necklace.

470
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,242
I didn't want it to feel beholden to me.
I didn't want it to be like episode of I Dream of Jeannie...

471
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:10,523
...where now you gotta save my life
in the time-space continuum...

472
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:12,843
...or you follow me around
with coconut oil and hotel towels....

473
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:14,281
-Coconut oil?
-I'm just saying--

474
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,768
-I don't feel beholden to you.
-Why not, I saved your life?

475
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,963
Can I have my necklace back?

476
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,888
Thank you.

477
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:27,014
I'll be in my office.

478
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,365
-Sam.
-Yeah.

479
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,006
Were you scared?

480
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:37,809
Yeah.

481
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,849
Me too.

482
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:43,810
Thanks.

483
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,461
-Good morning, C.J.
-Good morning.

484
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:58,137
We have an update and I can give you
a ballistics report so let's get started.

485
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:00,856
-C.J.!
-C.J.!

486
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:04,020
-ls he in there?
-No, no, no.

487
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:08,053
Ron.

488
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:11,017
Hey, Toby, I heard they're about to
take him off bypass.

489
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:12,976
Pretty soon yah.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?

490
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:16,695
Yeah. Sergeant, I want those people in
the corner back up another 200 feet.

491
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:20,256
And if they move in again,
handcuff'em to a parking meter.

492
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:21,860
-How's your hand?
-It's fine.

493
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:25,383
-You should be home.
-What's on your mind?

494
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:29,741
C.J.'s starting to get some questions about why
the president's exit wasn't covered in Rosslyn.

495
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:32,702
Secret Service doesn't
comment on procedure.

496
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:35,861
Ron, a few weeks after
the president was sworn in...

497
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:38,305
-...you got a memo about his protection.
-Yeah.

498
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,548
It said he wanted to enter
and exit in the open air.

499
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,789
-He didn't like traveling in a tank.
-Yeah.

500
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:49,423
It said he wouldn't use
the tent or the canopy anymore.

501
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,111
-Yeah.
-I wrote that memo.

502
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:54,590
-The president signed it at my urging.
-I know.

503
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,866
It's not right that the Secret Service
be blamed for last night.

504
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:00,907
I want the Treasury Department
to hand my memo to the press.

505
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,584
-We can't do that.
-There will be a lot of questions.

506
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,231
There are always a lot of questions.
Don't worry.

507
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,832
It's not right. You're the guys--

508
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,316
-Look at your hand.
-It's fine.

509
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:12,871
-Your hand is not fine.
-Toby.

510
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:15,870
-Let me go tell them it was my fault.
-lt wasn't your fault.

511
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:17,836
-Ron--
-lt wasn't your fault.

512
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:21,992
It wasn't Gina's fault, it wasn't
Charlie's, it wasn't anybody's, Toby.

513
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,991
It was an act of madmen.
You think a tent was gonna stop them?

514
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,317
We got the president into the car,
we got Zoey in the car...

515
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,751
...and at a 1 50 yards
and five stories up...

516
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:35,035
...the shooters were down 9. 2 seconds
after the first shot was fired.

517
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:38,240
I would never let you not
let me protect the president.

518
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:41,873
You tell us you don't like something,
we figure out something else.

519
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:44,272
It was an act of madmen.

520
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:47,562
Anyway, the Secret Service
doe'sn't comment on procedure.

521
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,204
Okay.

522
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,601
Good job last night.

523
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,637
Thank you.

524
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:08,004
Secret Service agents carry
a weapon called a.357 Sig-Sauer.

525
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:12,606
The agents on the roof shot the two
gunmen with. 726 caliber rifles...

526
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:14,801
...that are referred to as J-A-R...

527
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,643
...which, believe it or not, stands
for "just another rifle. "

528
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:22,089
They are made specifically
and exclusively for the Secret Service.

529
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:25,165
-I wanted to mention something.
-Leo.

530
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:27,921
This is our fifth press
briefing since midnight...

531
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,847
...and there's one story that
will dominate the news...

532
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:35,689
...around the world and it'd be easy
to think that President Bartlet...

533
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:38,808
...Joshua Lyman and Stephanie Abbott
were the only people...

534
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:42,525
...who were victims of a gun crime
last night. They weren't.

535
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:46,776
Mark Davis and Sheila Evans of
Philadelphia were killed last night.

536
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:50,810
He was a biology teacher,
and she was a nursing student.

537
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:54,015
Tina Bishop and Belinda Larkin
were killed with a gun last night.

538
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:55,850
They were 1 2.

539
00:31:55,938 --> 00:31:56,371
There were 36 homicides last night.

540
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,733
Four hundred and eighty
sexual assaults, 341 1 robberies...

541
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,939
...3685 aggravated assaults.

542
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,018
All at gunpoint.

543
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,015
If anyone thinks those crimes
could have been prevented...

544
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:12,376
...if the victims had guns...

545
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:16,178
... I'd remind you that the president of the
United States was shot last night...

546
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:20,935
...while surrounded by the best trained
guards in the history of the world.

547
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:23,942
Back to the briefing.

548
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:27,137
-She's good.
-Yes, she is.

549
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:31,135
I'm going to the hospital,
why don't you ride with me.

550
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:34,304
We're getting good exit polling
in Stark County and Rock lsland.

551
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:35,463
How good?

552
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,738
We're running 53 to 58
with the undecideds...

553
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:40,859
...from 72 hours ago
on the 1 2th, 1 4th and 1 5th.

554
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,586
-That's the money.
-DeWitt County.

555
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:45,019
-Yeah?
-Who you talking to?

556
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,464
I'm talking to nobody.
There's no one at my house.

557
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:48,659
What's going on?

558
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,067
Nothing. My dad had his chemo today.
These exit polls will cheer him up.

559
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,139
Sam says we got the 72 hour
undecideds in the 1 4th and 1 5th.

560
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,861
Leo, is there any food in
this room that isn't fried?

561
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:01,143
-lf there is, let's toss it.
-I'm not kidding.

562
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:03,583
Good exits from
Stark County and Rock lsland.

563
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:04,942
-How good?
-Good.

564
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,308
Leo, what the hell is this?

565
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:09,152
Sam's draft of your victory remarks.

566
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:12,232
"l congratulate my opponent on a
well-fought campaign. "

567
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:14,631
-You don't want to?
-I want to...

568
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:17,429
...but I'll call him by his name.
We're back to this?

569
00:33:17,716 --> 00:33:20,184
-Governor, we can--
-I wanna go over this with you.

570
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,432
Excuse me.

571
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,835
It's the exact same crap all over again.
It's amateur hour.

572
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,432
-Damn student....
-You can say it, you know.

573
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:31,391
It's not like I haven't heard it before.

574
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:35,469
Your husband's a real son
of a bitch, Mrs. Bartlet.

575
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,918
He doe'sn't like being handled.

576
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,157
I think if he looked around,
he'd see that nobody is handling him.

577
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,877
He's not ready yet, Josh.
He's terrified.

578
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:53,552
-ls he gonna be ready?
-You bet your ass he will.

579
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:58,360
In the meantime, you wanna
kick something, kick me.

580
00:33:58,964 --> 00:33:59,874
Toby.

581
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,399
-Got it.
-Here it comes.

582
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,676
With 17 percent
of the precincts reporting...

583
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:09,916
... we are ready to call the Illinois primary
for former New Hampshire governor....

584
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,595
Hey, hit the music.

585
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:22,041
-Y es!
-Hey! Way to go!

586
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,881
Now let's get to California.

587
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:27,879
Leo, we gotta replace this music.
Replace it with some Doobie Brothers.

588
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,369
-Josh.
-You gotta get happy.

589
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,881
You won the lllinois primary.
Come dance with me.

590
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:34,964
No. Josh. Your father died.

591
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:37,122
There's a lot of very
happy Bartlet supporters.

592
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:40,769
We are told the candidate is
in his suite refining his remarks.

593
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,924
He 's due to make an
appearance here any moment.

594
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:46,570
Just a little under an
hour ago now, this....

595
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:56,055
Welcome to O 'Hare International Airport.

596
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:00,335
We 'd like to remind you
this is a smoke-free airport.

597
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:05,690
Josh?

598
00:35:06,778 --> 00:35:08,053
Governor....

599
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,016
Your father died, Josh.
I can't believe it.

600
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:12,894
Y eah. Governor, you shouldn't be here.

601
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,416
-What happened?
-Flight leaving for St. Louis.

602
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,931
He went in for his chemotherapy...

603
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:23,937
...and he developed what's called
a pulmonary embolism, it's a--

604
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:26,576
-It's a blood clot.
-Yeah.

605
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:29,616
It went to his heart
and there was cardiac arrest.

606
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:33,783
Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:36,134
Governor, you should get
back to the ballroom...

608
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:39,303
...so you can get on a plane
and get to California.

609
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:42,903
-He was a lawyer?
-Yeah. A litigator.

610
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:44,937
Did he like that you were in politics?

611
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,025
I think he would've liked
grandchildren more.

612
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,184
He would've.

613
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,262
He liked that I work for you,
that we were doing well.

614
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:55,858
He would've liked tonight.

615
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:01,828
At least his friends and the neighbors
will be spared all the, you know....

616
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,702
He'd be doing some
bragging right now?

617
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,024
Your name wouldn't have come up.
"My son won the lllinois primary. "

618
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:15,230
Three more hours, he would
have been able to say that.

619
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:17,951
He'd have been proud.

620
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:21,910
He was already.
Trust me, Josh, I'm a father.

621
00:36:22,674 --> 00:36:24,905
He was already.

622
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:32,906
I appreciate that, governor.
You should really get back to the hotel.

623
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:34,715
No.

624
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:39,071
I appreciate your having come here,
but people are waiting for a speech.

625
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:40,952
They'll wait.

626
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:44,994
Yeah, they will, but the people
watching television won't.

627
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,508
-I've been a real jackass to you, Josh.
-Well....

628
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,791
T o everybody.

629
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,710
-Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn.
-Yeah.

630
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,357
I know what you gave up
to work for this campaign...

631
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:00,633
...and don't think
I don't know your value.

632
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,835
And I'll never make
you think I don't again.

633
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,233
You gotta be impressed that
I got those names right.

634
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:13,554
Delta Airlines flight 175 for Kennedy
International now boarding at gate 56.

635
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:18,163
-They're calling my flight.
-You want me to go with you?

636
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:20,636
-Go with me?
-Maybe you want company.

637
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:22,360
I can get a ticket and go with you.

638
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,160
Governor.

639
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:26,682
California.

640
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:32,761
You have to go and give a speech
in prime time and go to California.

641
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,607
-I guess you're right.
-You guess?

642
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,848
Listen to me, governor,
if you don't lose this election...

643
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,088
...it isn't gonna be because
you didn't try hard enough.

644
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,610
But it was nice of you to ask.

645
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,091
Thank you, I appreciate it.

646
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,323
Flight 175
to Kennedy International....

647
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,723
They' re calling your flight.

648
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:26,009
Is he gonna be all right?

649
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,972
-He's gonna be fine.
-Good.

650
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:39,419
-Leo?
-Yeah.

651
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:42,014
I'm ready.

652
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:55,656
Tonight, what began at the Commons
in Concord, Massachusetts...

653
00:38:55,946 --> 00:39:00,862
...as an alliance of farmers and
workers, of cobblers and tinsmiths...

654
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:04,902
... of statesmen and students,
of mothers and wives...

655
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,387
... of men and boys...

656
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:11,299
... Iives two centuries later
as America.

657
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:13,865
My name is Josiah Bartlet...

658
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,266
... and I accept your nomination...

659
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,863
... for the presidency
of the United States.

660
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:49,874
Josh. Josh, wake up, it's okay.
I want you to wake up.

661
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:52,677
I couldn't hear you, Josh.

662
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,472
What'd he say?

663
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,115
He said, "What's next? "

664
