00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,915
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,111
Josh was shot in the chest.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,631
Forty percent of teachers in Oregon
reported having insufficient textbooks--

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,592
T extbooks are important.
If for no other reason...

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,952
...than they'd accurately place Kirkwood
in California, not Oregon.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,434
-We should hire her.
-She's a Republican.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,836
-Appeal to her sense of duty.
-I'm offering her a job.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,270
What made you think I wouldn't
scream where there are people?

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,516
Did you meet anyone there
who isn't worthless?

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,951
Don't call them worthless.
They are patriots, and I'm their lawyer.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,918
-Don't shout.
-Donna, come here!

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,836
-Did you hear me say don't shout?
-No.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,269
-Know why?
-You weren't shouting.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,515
-That's right.
-Right.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,837
-What's the problem?
-They still say I owe them $50,000...

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,079
...and that "failure to pay will result
in a negative report on your credit. "

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,316
-On my credit?
-On my credit. Sam!

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,033
-Don't shout.
-I got another letter.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,669
-Don't worry.
-I am worried.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,518
-I called an insurance guy.
-They're referring me...

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,439
...to insurance code 4336.
You know what that means?

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,709
Okay. There's $50,000 worth of hospital
bills they're saying they don't cover.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,876
Know what that means?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,196
You may have to get a job
mowing lawns.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,674
Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,757
Don't shout. Sam.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,510
-I'm doing the radio today.
-What's it about?

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,199
-You don't know what it's about?
-No.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,715
You're a speechwriter.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,275
I'm the deputy communications director.
I don't do the radio address.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,710
I think this one's about leaves turning.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,797
-Not surprised.
-Will he take it seriously?

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,956
-The president?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,390
-Why wouldn't he take it seriously?
-You don't.

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,351
Don't have to read it.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,353
It's the end of the week,
he gets punchy.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,308
-It's not live. Do another take.
-Remember last April?

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,119
-Eleven takes.
-I remember.

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,272
What did he say? Insurance code 9336?

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,876
4336. I had to give
those people key chains.

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
-What people?
-Guests at the address with 1 1 takes.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,633
They were standing
for an hour and a half.

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,239
I sent them home
with White House key chains.

44
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,750
-Knock them dead.
-Wait. Stay here for a second.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,029
-Why?
-I'm doing my thing.

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,958
-I've seen that.
-I'm adding a joke.

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,992
-I'm sure it's great.
-Just, you know....

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,913
Sure.

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,676
Excuse me.

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,234
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,909
Welcome to the White House.
My name is Donatella Moss.

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,909
I work here as an assistant
to Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Lyman.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,352
Which, I guess, makes me
deputy, deputy chief of staff.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,673
Okay. We're gonna go over to the
Oval Office now if you'll follow me.

55
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,871
As you probably know,
the president doe's...

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,755
...a regular Saturday morning radio
address which he records on Friday.

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,349
The address is usually
two to three minutes in length.

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,837
When it's over, the president
will be happy to stand for pictures.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,918
I'm gonna ask you to form
a horseshoe against that wall.

60
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,877
Not an actual horseshoe. That takes
special training as a blacksmith.

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,995
Okay.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,311
Thank God.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,712
-How's it going?
-They didn't laugh at the blacksmith joke.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,230
That's almost hard to believe.
How is everybody?

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,748
Good morning, sir.

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,115
-We all set for the speech?
-Not quite.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,072
-What do you need, sir?
-The speech.

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,990
-Right here.
-Thank you.

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,918
-Let's do this in one, shall we?
-Yes.

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,795
One-take Bartlet, that's what
old Jack Warner used to call me.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,195
Here we go in three...

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,879
...two....

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,796
"Good morning. This month, as autumn
is in full bloom in much of the nation...

74
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,959
...the weekends will be devoted by many
of you to leaf peeping and football"--

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,468
What?

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,474
-Cut tape.
-I'm sorry.

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,877
Leaf peeping?
Is that something we do now?

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,871
-T ry another.
-Better get some key chains.

79
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,952
-I heard that.
-Here we go in three...

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,999
...two....

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,915
Okay, let's cut.

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,998
Sorry, everybody. This is gonna be it.
Four is my lucky number.

83
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,191
-This is take five.
-Five is my lucky number.

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,151
Fifth-take Bartlet...

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,552
-...that's what Jack Warner called me.
-Did you know Jack Warner?

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,879
Yeah. I used to be a contract player
in Hollywood, and I'm 97 years old.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,674
-Okay.
-Here we go. In three, two....

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,108
-C.J.?
-How you doing, Toby?

89
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,511
I'm fine. Thanks. Listen--

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,075
Have you noticed that I am
one of the few people here...

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,915
...whose nose isn't bent
out of shape over Ainsley Hayes?

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,992
-Yeah. Listen--
-I'm serious.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,438
You heard the news, and you
slammed the door so hard it broke.

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,995
-You broke the White House.
-Yeah, but I'm over it now.

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,152
Other people aren't,
and they should get over it.

96
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,311
I'll see what I can--

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,916
I don't think it's that
she's a Republican.

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,470
It's that she's a Republican woman,
and good-looking.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,911
Well, those are three things when
in combination usually spell careerism.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,630
It's sexist, and I'm
coming down on her side.

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,990
-Good for you. Look--
-I am serious about this.

102
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,317
Ed Barrie's doing Meet the Press
on Sunday.

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,037
Did you know that?

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,959
-No. This Sunday?
-Day after tomorrow.

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,837
He's retiring.
Maybe it's a farewell kind--

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,317
He's also doing Sam and Cokie,
Late Edition, and Capitol Beat.

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,117
-Are you sure about this?
-Sam got it from Mark Gottfried.

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,029
-Has anyone talked to Judy?
-The DOD press office isn't confirming.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,949
Won't confirm whether a general
is going on TV to beat up the president?

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,275
-No.
-Carol?

111
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,836
By the way,
you are a beautiful woman.

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,316
And no one around has ever assumed
you are either ambitious or stupid.

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,791
-Toby?
-Yeah?

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,879
It took two years.

115
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,313
I need to see General Barrie.
Go to the Pentagon and get him.

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,950
I don't want him near
a press line when he comes.

117
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,475
Earliest convenience?

118
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,988
I could give a damn
if it's convenient.

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,792
-He's the Army chief of staff, C.J.
-I work for his boss, so get him here.

120
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,596
-Want some help?
-No.

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,195
Have a nice day.

122
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
Has Leo told Tribbey
about his new Associate Counsel yet?

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,959
I'll check to see if any maimings
have been reported.

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,879
-I don't think he's told him.
-Should be decent dinner theater.

125
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,271
Let me know if you need me
on Captain Queeg.

126
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,110
He was okay with it?

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,470
He thinks it's great.
He can't wait to meet you.

128
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,954
Lionel T ribbey?

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,198
Lionel T ribbey thinks hiring me
was a great idea?

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,993
-Why are you surprised?
-Well...

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,193
... because I'm a Republican
and Lionel T ribbey is incredibly not.

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,391
Lionel T ribbey
is the White House counsel.

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,035
He is a brilliant
and fair-minded attorney...

134
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,956
...and he will accept you on his staff
because he is, well, fair-minded.

135
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,998
-Because--
-You haven't told him yet.

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,272
I have in fact
not told him yet. No.

137
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,879
So you lied to me just then.

138
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,516
I'm a politician, Ainsley.
Of course I lied to you just then.

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,358
My first day is getting off
to a great start.

140
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,273
-It's about to get better.
-Why?

141
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,431
Leo?

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,194
Lionel T ribbey is on his way.

143
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,231
-I just wanna die.
-It's the White House.

144
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,999
-You get used to that feeling.
-I should go.

145
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,759
-Ainsley.
-No. Maybe I should go...

146
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,554
-...so you can talk--
-Meet him now. It's gonna be fine.

147
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,877
It's not gonna be fine. He'll yell
and scream. I've seen him on TV.

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,958
That's TV. He's making
a full-throated defense of the president.

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,152
That's what we do.
In real life, when the cameras are off--

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,228
Leo!

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,072
I will kill people today, Leo.
I will kill people with this cricket bat...

152
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,949
...given to me by Her Royal Majesty
Elizabeth Windsor.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,351
Then I'll kill them again
with my own hands.

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,988
Has anybody in this building
heard of contempt of Congress?

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
Congress will hold
the White House in contempt, Leo.

156
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,193
Nothing compared to the contempt
in which I will hold the White House...

157
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,716
-...if this keeps happening.
-What did we do?

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,514
Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline
testified at Governmental Affairs...

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,075
...that the White House couldn't
produce the Rockland memo...

160
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,630
... because the White House
didn't have the Rockland memo.

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,558
-Do we?
-Holding it in my hand!

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,512
-There's--
-When your guys go to the Hill...

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,834
...they can't drop their testimony
on my desk at 9: 1 5 and testify at 9:30.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,509
I was ready to take a vacation.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,792
I was gonna go someplace warm,
with a beach.

166
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,629
Somebody bringing me drinks
with little umbrellas in them.

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,948
I had this closed. Now I gotta go back
up there, because a circus is in town.

168
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,196
-Who is this?
-This is Ainsley Hayes.

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,391
She's scared of meeting you,
so be nice.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,428
The girl who's been writing
the columns.

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,908
-You're an idiot.
-Leo--

172
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,555
She's not an idiot, Lionel.
She clerked for Dreifort.

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,434
-Well, Dreifort's an idiot.
-Dreifort's a Supreme Court Justice.

174
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,708
Speak of him with respect and practice
intolerance for those who disagree.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,390
I believe as long as Justice Dreifort
is intolerant toward gays, lesbians...

176
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,830
... blacks, unions,
women, poor people...

177
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,076
...and the First, Fourth, Fifth,
and Ninth Amendments...

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,512
... I will remain intolerant toward him.
Nice to meet you.

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,714
She's working for you, Lionel.

180
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,913
-Excuse me?
-She's working for you.

181
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,870
The president asked me
to hire her for your office.

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,591
The president of what
asked you to hire her for my office?

183
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,030
The United States.

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,032
Excuse me.

185
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,435
It went pretty well.

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,030
Our farming families stand for the values
that keep our nation strong:

187
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,875
Faith, calm perseverance,
and patience.

188
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,517
Mr. President, have you lost what little was
left of your mind? I can't work like this.

189
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,994
-Dear God.
-Cut.

190
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,759
-I had it.
-ls this a bad time?

191
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,758
-It's a bit of a bad time.
-Forgive me.

192
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,951
When you have a few moments,
I'd like to discuss the hiring...

193
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,708
...of a blond fascist whose knowledge
doe'sn't include...

194
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,872
...the proper order of the alphabet for
positions of the White House Counsel.

195
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,391
And we will. But right now,
I don't know if you've noticed...

196
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,875
...but there are 30 or 40
other people in the room.

197
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,995
Many of whom have donated significant
amounts of money to the Democrats.

198
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,192
Perhaps you could get
a tighter grip on your horses...

199
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,516
...and we will talk about it later.

200
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,028
Yes.

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,473
Well....

202
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,196
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

203
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,516
Thank you, Mr. President.

204
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,432
Obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant
lawyer whom we cannot live without.

205
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,831
Or there would be very little reason
not to put him in prison. Let's try again.

206
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,555
You got two paragraphs on H-404
for the AFL-ClO I want you to rethink.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,353
Rethink them how?

208
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,039
Cut them.

209
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,034
Why can't he talk
about Superfund?

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,159
The AFL-ClO want to hear
about how we'll protect their jobs.

211
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,278
How about we start
by protecting the planet?

212
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,830
How about you start
by cutting the paragraphs?

213
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,315
-Fine.
-What are you doing?

214
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,639
T rying to help Josh with his insurance
thing. The hospital was out-of-network.

215
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,118
They' re claiming responsibility for only
20 percent of a life-saving procedure.

216
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,359
Also, he didn't get the procedure
cleared for him.

217
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,949
His lung was collapsed,
and blood stopped flowing to his brain...

218
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,357
...he was supposed to dial the automated
24-hour customer service line?

219
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,198
If it keeps up,
he's gonna have to sue.

220
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,875
I like a country where you
sue the insurance company...

221
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,479
... but not who shot you.

222
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,391
Anyway, cut the two paragraphs.

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,758
What?

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,916
He can sue the people
that shot him.

225
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,992
The people who shot him are dead.

226
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,670
No. Hardly any of them are.

227
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,995
Take 1 7 looked like
it was gonna be a keeper...

228
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,272
...until he went on elocution safari
during the word "protuberance. "

229
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,790
-When did he finally nail it?
-He hasn't yet.

230
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,752
He hasn't done it yet?

231
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,150
There are matters of State
to attend to.

232
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,908
-He can't spend the day indefinitely--
-And the audience?

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,950
I sent them home. I'll bring in a new
audience, like the old Carson Show.

234
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,830
-What the hell are we talking about?
-Did you know leaf peeping was a thing?

235
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,073
-Josh Lyman.
-Leaf peeping?

236
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,231
Yeah.

237
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,633
Sam wants to see you.

238
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,433
Insurance victory.

239
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,951
"And the weak shall be made mighty, "
Donna. Not " might is right"...

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,958
...but rather "might for right. "

241
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,834
-This relates to leaf peeping how?
-lt doe'sn't.

242
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,951
Don't eat my french fries.

243
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,468
Good. Come on in.

244
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,273
-Did you beat them into submission?
-No.

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,830
-Beat them at all?
-Forget about the insurance.

246
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,997
Unless the insurance company
forgets about--

247
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,350
The Southern Poverty Law Center.

248
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,035
You know for the three months
you were out recovering...

249
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,115
... people were looking for a new avenue
for law enforcement to get extremists.

250
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,990
-Throw out the Bill of Rights.
-Toby tried.

251
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,713
I was kidding.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,116
Josh, this is our way in,
a civil action.

253
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,870
You could subpoena everything.
Membership roles, donor roles...

254
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,355
...weapons inventory,
computer downloads.

255
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,756
Depose everyone
who's ever been to a meeting...

256
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,429
...and every man and woman
they name.

257
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,071
Josh, the Southern Poverty
Law Center...

258
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,873
...wants you to sue
the Ku Klux Klan...

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,954
...for 100 million dollars.

260
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,758
Donna called. She said
don't be late for budget.

261
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,038
I gotta go.

262
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,635
-Charlie.
-Good afternoon, ma'am.

263
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,433
Is the president free for a moment?

264
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,029
He's with the Far East advisors.
Would you like me to--?

265
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,557
No, no. Don't interrupt him.
Korea might have more plutonium.

266
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,229
Give him a message for me.
You wanna write this down.

267
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,676
Your blood pressure is 1 20/80.

268
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,075
How did you know that?

269
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,318
-I'm saying his blood pressure.
-It's 1 20/80.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,670
Yeah. Your EKG
shows a good sinus rhythm.

271
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,712
-No evidence of ischemic changes.
-Spelling--

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,356
Doe'sn't matter. Electrolytes and
metabolic panels are within normal limits.

273
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,677
Chest x-ray is clear,
and prostate screens are fine.

274
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,275
So we can have sex now.

275
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,428
-Okay, that's not me and you, right?
-Go.

276
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,470
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Landingham.

277
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,318
-How are you today?
-I'm fine. Thank you.

278
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,951
-Are you looking for the president?
-I imagine he'll be along in a moment.

279
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,759
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

280
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,917
-Good afternoon, Mr. President.
-Good afternoon.

281
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,713
-ls there anything I can--?
-Go away.

282
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,390
-You seem a little tense.
-Not for long.

283
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,114
-Why don't we go inside?
-Absolutely.

284
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,195
Would you like me to inform
Mr. McGarry and the advisors--?

285
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,754
-BP, 1 20/80.
-Who cares? It's been 1 4 weeks.

286
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,996
-Do these curtains close?
-Not here, Jed.

287
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,872
-Yes, right. Where?
-How about our bedroom?

288
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,749
New Hampshire's
an hour and a half by plane.

289
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,189
Our bedroom in the residence?

290
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,948
Yes! We have a bedroom right here.
That was so smart.

291
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,189
-Yes.
-Let's go.

292
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,118
-What?
-Korea, plutonium.

293
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,273
-God. I hate plutonium.
-We have to find time before 6.

294
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,431
What happens at 6?

295
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,592
I fly to Cochran's Mills,
Pennsylvania.

296
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,871
-Where the hell is Cochran's Mills?
-Pennsylvania.

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,432
-Right.
-So you talk to Charlie. I'll talk to Lilly.

298
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,631
We'll coordinate,
and find a free hour.

299
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,434
It won't take more than a couple of
minutes, but I like your confidence.

300
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,836
-Back to work.
-Can't we just close the curtains?

301
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,872
Let's get back to work.

302
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,229
-C.J.
-ls he here?

303
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,475
-He sent--
-Carol!

304
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,034
He sent an aide.

305
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,675
Lt. Buckley.

306
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,632
-C.J.
-Ms. Cregg.

307
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,037
Lt. Buckley. I'm a staff aide to Gen.
Barrie. You need to speak with him?

308
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,470
-I do. So, what are you doing here?
-I'm an aide--

309
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,909
I heard you the first time.
Where's the general?

310
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,595
-The general sent me.
-I'm gonna send you back.

311
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,950
-lf I could know--
-ls he doing the morning shows?

312
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,793
I wouldn't know that, ma'am.

313
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,116
I would know, and I do,
and so do you.

314
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,550
-Ma'am--
-He'll go on TV and trash the president.

315
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,274
-Last thing he doe's before he retires?
-It's not for--

316
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,320
Lieutenant!
He's gonna trash the president?

317
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,711
It's not a surprise that Gen. Barrie...

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,594
... has some serious disagreements
with this administration.

319
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,952
-Particularly, your president.
-My president is your president too.

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,955
He has some real concerns over the
state of readiness of our armed forces.

321
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,908
That shouldn't get people
alarmed for no reason.

322
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,118
He feels that taking this opportunity
to express his opinions...

323
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,715
...which are considered
at the most expert level--

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,120
T aking this opportunity before he leaves
this service is his patriotic obligation.

325
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,036
-It's called " ring and run. "
-Ma'am--

326
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,269
Go back to the Pentagon.

327
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,632
T ell Gen. Barrie
C.J. Cregg says he's a coward.

328
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,637
I'll be honest with you. I didn't
even know we had offices down here.

329
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,319
That bodes well for me.

330
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,910
-I wonder what else we got down here?
-Bats, possibly?

331
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,988
Room 442 is what we'relooking for.

332
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,914
I wouldn't be surprised
if we see it any second now.

333
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,551
-You didn't need to take me down here.
-There's no way you'd find it.

334
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,513
-You're the White House chief of staff--
-Don't worry about it.

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,675
442. Where the hell is it?

336
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,513
You've been really decent to me.
I wanna thank you for that.

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,468
Kid, the others
are gonna come around.

338
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,431
No, they won't.

339
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,558
Remember that the people
you' re talking about...

340
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,037
...Iive their lives under siege,
24 hours, every day.

341
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,993
At a time in their lives
when they' re trying to do good...

342
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,429
...you' re in their foxhole.

343
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,030
Sam Seaborn had this innocent
relationship with a girl, bam!

344
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,478
Here comes the enemy.
I'm a recovering alcoholic, bam!

345
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,036
Radio, TV, magazines,
cameras in front of my house.

346
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,914
People shouting at my daughter
at the ball game.

347
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,031
Editorials, op-eds.

348
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,949
"He's a drunk. He's dangerous.
He should resign. "

349
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,475
-I wrote one of those op-ed pieces.
-I know.

350
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,958
It's right over here.

351
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,510
442.

352
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,309
It's written down here, this is the
steam pipe trunk distribution venue.

353
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,997
I'm working in the steam pipe
trunk distribution venue?

354
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,919
No, you're working in your office.

355
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,919
Well--

356
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,269
Thank you for the help.

357
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,911
Ainsley, don't worry about Sam
or Josh and Toby...

358
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,679
...or C.J. or the Democrats on the Hill
or the Republicans on TV.

359
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,349
You're here to serve the president.

360
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,359
Anyway...

361
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,469
...welcome to the White House.

362
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,956
Leo?

363
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,869
Mr. Tribbey.

364
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,395
-I see they found you an office.
-Such as it is.

365
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,994
Good men and women have worked
in whatever room was available...

366
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,152
...and have done so
without complaint.

367
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,039
I don't believe
you heard me complain.

368
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,078
I believe I did, Ms. Hayes.

369
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,152
Why don't you tell me
what this is about?

370
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,278
-Sir?
-These people are trying to do something.

371
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,797
I'll have their backs while they're trying.
What are you doing here?

372
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,196
-Serving my country.
-Why not join the Navy?

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,118
-I was asked to do this.
-And you said yes?

374
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,637
-Why?
-I feel a sense of duty.

375
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,992
I'm sorry?

376
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,994
I said, I feel a sense of duty.

377
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,948
What, did you just walk out
of The Pirates of Penzance?

378
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,714
" He's an Englishman. "

379
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,512
-That's from H.M. S. Pinafore.
-It's from Penzance.

380
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,950
Don't tell me
about Gilbert and Sullivan.

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,952
It's from Penzance or Iolanthe.
One of the ones about duty.

382
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,515
They' re all about duty.
And it's from Pinafore.

383
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,471
Ms. Hayes--

384
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,997
Is it so hard to believe that someone
would roll up their sleeves...

385
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
...set aside partisanship
and say, "What can I do? "

386
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,629
Yes.

387
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,476
I want you to go up
to the Hill this afternoon...

388
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,069
...and talk to the associate majority
counsel at Governmental Affairs.

389
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,835
You're sending me
because I speak Republican.

390
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,595
Yes. Two staffers
in the Communications Office:

391
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,949
Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline.

392
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,512
The two you wanted to kill for screwing
up on possession of the memo.

393
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,869
Yes.

394
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,918
Read about it, then fix it.

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,553
I will.

396
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,072
-And thank you for asking me.
-Yeah.

397
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,119
Mr. Tribbey?

398
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,153
I'd like to do well on this.

399
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,073
Any advice you could give
that might point...

400
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,028
...the way of success
would be appreciated.

401
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,872
Not speaking in iambic pentameter
might be a step in the right direction.

402
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,152
The president's way too moderate
for your taste.

403
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,874
Excuse me?

404
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,829
On affirmative action, capital gains,
public schools, free trade.

405
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,193
You left a lucrative practice in Chicago
and a seven-figure income.

406
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,037
It wasn't out of duty?

407
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,711
How are they tying the two shooters
and the signal guy to the Klan?

408
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,195
They' re tying them to the Klan,
West Virginia White Pride...

409
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,959
-... Brotherhood of Aryan Nations.
-How--?

410
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,556
The following is in the possession
of the FBl:

411
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,957
A map and the president's itinerary
given to the shooters...

412
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,710
... by the chapter head of White Pride,
a videotape of a meeting...

413
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,468
...with the leader railing
against interracial couples...

414
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,432
...specifically citing
Charlie and Zoey...

415
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,957
... using the term "lone wolf" over and
over, which is the phrase they use...

416
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,312
...when they want younger members
to take matters into their own hands.

417
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,831
A copy of Hunter by William Pierce
bought at a rally in Blacksburg.

418
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,680
In the book, Pierce encourages
supremacists to rid the earth...

419
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,871
...of interracial couples
by shooting them.

420
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,118
This is more than enough
to begin deposing witnesses.

421
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,879
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

422
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,039
I just wanted to tell you that Joyce
and Brookline are at it again.

423
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,958
-What'd they do?
-T old Government Affairs...

424
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,630
-...we never had the Rockland memo.
-I think we did have the Rockland memo.

425
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,592
We did. Would you talk to them?

426
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,916
I also better talk to somebody
in Government Affairs.

427
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,595
-T ribbey already sent Ainsley Hayes.
-T o do what?

428
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,155
T alk to the associate--

429
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,953
That's something I couldn't do?

430
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,959
He wanted to send a lawyer.

431
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,873
I'm a lawyer.
Everybody in the room is.

432
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,873
-From the Counsel's Office.
-Good.

433
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,032
I'll tell everybody
to cross their fingers.

434
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,875
If the story hasn't been leaked,
we withheld evidence.

435
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,832
Sam, that's enough.

436
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,791
-Anything else?
-No.

437
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,599
Thank you.

438
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,232
His point isn't wholly
without merit, Leo.

439
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,398
-What do you need?
-Sam was talking to me.

440
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,474
-The Southern Poverty Law Center--
-We know.

441
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,718
What do you think?

442
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,914
-Well, I'm not wild about it.
-Why?

443
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,599
Our people can be deposed too...

444
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,519
...which leaves them vulnerable
to embarrassing questions like:

445
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,638
Have you ever tried cocaine?

446
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,911
They can ask Sam
if he slept with a prostitute.

447
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,668
-Those are irrelevant.
-That's why they'll ask.

448
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,951
If our people refuse to answer,
it's a story.

449
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,037
-We're not wild about it.
-That said...

450
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,677
...say the word, we'll take a leave
of absence, and join your legal team.

451
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,997
"He is an Englishman"
is from Pinafore.

452
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,840
-Tribbey says it's from Penzance.
-It's from Pinafore.

453
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,509
-He says it's the one about duty.
-They' re all about duty.

454
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,758
I wanna be very clear,
I could give a damn.

455
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,919
Okay. Quiet, kids.

456
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,839
Saturday morning radio address,
take 21.

457
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,429
I have a really good feeling
about this one, sir.

458
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,632
-ls this still my first term?
-Yes, but I do take your point.

459
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,990
-We've spent a bit of time on this.
-Here we go.

460
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,475
In five, four, three...

461
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,715
...two....

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,149
-Good evening.
-Cut.

463
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,799
-What?
-It's morning.

464
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,911
It's evening. It's dark outside.

465
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,236
It's evening now.
It's morning tomorrow.

466
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,670
What time is it?

467
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,877
It's 5:45, sir.

468
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,792
-Here we go.
-ln five--

469
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,433
Excuse me.

470
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,790
Oh, no.

471
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,792
-I can't. I gotta go.
-Sir, l--

472
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,471
Kids, I am so sorry. I have
to go now to a special meeting...

473
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,353
...of the government.

474
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,633
I will mail you all an autograph copy
of the picture we took together.

475
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,956
And one day, you will all understand.

476
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,273
-Mr. President.
-Take a break.

477
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,835
-She's not there.
-I'm going to a special meeting.

478
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,192
Of the government. Yes, sir.
She had to go to Pennsylvania early.

479
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,552
Like to come back inside and take
another swing at the radio address?

480
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,239
Sure.

481
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,953
Like to get that smile
off your face...

482
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,715
... before I send you on assignment
to the Yukon?

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,274
Yes, sir.

484
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,676
-General, I'm sorry. She can't--
-I've ordered many men on assignment.

485
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,315
I've sent them to Hue City,
Khe Sahn Village, Da Nang--

486
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,589
-Sir--
-Don't interrupt!

487
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,314
I've sent them to Grenada.
I've sent them to Haiti.

488
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,075
And I've sent them
to lraqi-occupied Kuwait.

489
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,999
-All acts of cowardice?
-Sir--

490
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,948
You think sending my aide here
was an act of cowardice?

491
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,031
You think I have the time
and inclination--

492
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,276
Sir, that wasn't
what I was referring to.

493
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,835
Jumping up and down
on the commander in chief...

494
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,395
...then beating a path out of town
is an act of cowardice.

495
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,878
I think alerting the public to
staggeringly dangerous vulnerabilities...

496
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,072
...of the current state of the military
is an act of conscience.

497
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,352
I would too, sir, except--
Again, I say this with all due respect--

498
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,915
Shove your respect!
I don't want it!

499
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,033
I say this with all due respect.
I think your motives are personal.

500
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,276
-I'd like to discuss that, sir.
-Sure.

501
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,519
How about we discuss new defense
spending being down to 300 billion...

502
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,916
...from 400 billion 1 0 years ago.
Is that personal?

503
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,550
No, that's about the Cold War
ending 1 0 years ago...

504
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,319
...and America not needing
to spend much money...

505
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,870
...defending against a country
that can't bake bread.

506
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,958
Kitten, optempo is up,
which is fine.

507
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,471
But the problem is, perstempo is up too.
Do you know what that is?

508
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,194
-It's a rate of turnover in individual jobs.
-Yes, sir.

509
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,636
Perstempo is up because
higher-paying civilian jobs...

510
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,717
...Iure men and women
trained in high tech.

511
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,514
We're happy to take the rap
for a booming economy, sir.

512
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,234
Two divisions: The 1 0th
Mountain Division at Fort Drum...

513
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,678
...and the 1 st lnfantry in Germany
have been rated C-4.

514
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,428
That's the lowest of four
possible readiness grades.

515
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,712
-lt means " unfit for service. "
-No, sir. Again, with all respect...

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,118
...it means unfit for service based
on the Pentagon's "two-war doctrine. "

517
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,949
It's based on how fast these divisions
would be able to extract themselves...

518
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,038
...from their peacekeeping mission,
retrain on home bases...

519
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,633
...and ship off to a second of two
full-scale, Gulf War-size conflicts.

520
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,992
There are also some, inside and outside
the Pentagon, who questioned...

521
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,955
...whether the C-4 ratings might not be
a maneuver on the part of the DOD...

522
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,312
...to help Republican allies in Congress
secure more defense money.

523
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,195
Well, I'll be telling my story
to Tim Russert.

524
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,079
No, I don't think you will, general.

525
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,118
-I'm sorry?
-I said, I don't think you will.

526
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,958
I notice among your many decorations is
the Distinguished Combat Service Medal.

527
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,591
You're wearing it now,
as well as in numerous photographs...

528
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,429
...including some taken
with enlisted men in the field.

529
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,391
You won it while on temporary duty
with the Navy's USS Brooke.

530
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,869
The thing is, the Brooke was never
fired on, and it never shot its guns.

531
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,675
Right now and in photographs,
you' re wearing a medal you never won.

532
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,633
How doe's that usually go over
with the boys?

533
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,553
He never served in uniform,
not once.

534
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,952
-And he presumes--
-ls there anything else, sir?

535
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,555
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline.

536
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,395
-Steve. Mark.
-Thanks.

537
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,910
Hi. I'm Ainsley Hayes.

538
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,799
Mark Brookline.

539
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,195
Steve Joyce.

540
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,715
Is there some place
more private we can speak?

541
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,118
-What do you think, the Oval Office?
-The Oval Office works.

542
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,879
Or the Cabinet Room.

543
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,515
Why don't we just step out
into the hall?

544
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,951
-Okay, we'll keep our voices down.
-Okay.

545
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,999
Lionel T ribbey asked me
to take care of the false testimony...

546
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,599
...you gave to Governmental Affairs.

547
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,916
-False testimony?
-Regarding the Rockland memo.

548
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,473
Look at your watch, Steve. Seventeen
seconds it took her to call us liars.

549
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,636
Fellas, that's not what I was saying.
I chose the wrong word, and I apologize.

550
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,559
Mistaken testimony,
you' re absolutely right.

551
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,310
I spoke to the Associate Counsel,
and I think we'regonna be fine.

552
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,917
-Two things I wanted to mention--
-Mark. I'm sorry, I have work to do.

553
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,879
-Yeah.
-No, this'll just take a second.

554
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,874
First of all, forgive me
if I'm repeating somebody else...

555
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,954
...but I'd be remiss if I didn't
make sure you understood...

556
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,596
...section 1 94 of the Federal Code
says Congress can turn your testimony...

557
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,474
...over to a U.S. attorney,
and he'd impanel a grand jury.

558
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,951
-You don't want any part of that.
-Thanks.

559
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,390
You know, we both went to high school.

560
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,159
Yeah.

561
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,676
The second thing is this:

562
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,997
Your attitude during your testimony
is being taken by some...

563
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,955
...of the Republican committee
members as a sign of disrespect.

564
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,873
-Please.
-No, hang on a second.

565
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,511
This is so easy to fix,
we are gonna pick up yardage.

566
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,872
Write a short note, have it delivered
by messenger to the Majority Counsel...

567
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,952
...copy the chairman
and the speaker.

568
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,913
Your first act on the job
is asking us to apologize...

569
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,031
...to Republicans on the Governmental
Affairs Committee.

570
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,598
-And the speaker of the House.
-Because they didn't like our attitude?

571
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,870
Yeah. I know this doe'sn't look good.

572
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,915
But the fact is,
it's the smart thing to do.

573
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,038
And if you don't do it
at my suggestion...

574
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,638
...Lionel Tribbey is gonna come here,
and you're gonna have to do it at his.

575
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,070
-I have work to do.
-Yeah.

576
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,551
Good evening.

577
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,953
It's very important that nobody
tries to kill me in the next hour or so.

578
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,108
Where have you been?

579
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,672
On a conference call with Cardinal Law
and the archbishop of Chicago.

580
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,714
-You couldn't get off the phone?
-" Excuse me, Your Eminence.

581
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,958
The first lady is a little randy,
and she says I'm good to go. "

582
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,878
-I am randy.
-Good. Take your clothes off.

583
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,989
What ever happened to romance,
a couple of cocktails, Mel T ormé?

584
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,350
-Get them off.
-I'm going to the bathroom...

585
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,915
...where I am gonna change
into a special little garment...

586
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,550
-...I think you might enjoy.
-You have two minutes...

587
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,876
...or I swear, I'm gonna get
Mrs. Landingham drunk.

588
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,999
Loosen your tie.
Loosen whatever you'd like.

589
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,472
What was that thing you were doing?

590
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,155
-When?
-T onight in Pennsylvania.

591
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,998
You know what it was.

592
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,350
It was a monument dedication,
or a statue.

593
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,073
-Yeah.
-Statue to who?

594
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,959
Nellie Bly.

595
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,470
You went all the way
to Cochran's whatever...

596
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,990
...to dedicate a monument
to Nellie Bly?

597
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,033
Abbey, you can really pass
that kind of thing along.

598
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,471
You don't have to accept invitations
from every historical society...

599
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,955
...that knows someone
in the Social Office.

600
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,310
If you want, I can have Charlie--

601
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,556
You haven't changed
into the special garment.

602
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,033
Cochran's Mills is where I went.

603
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,479
You know what I did just then?
It was stupid.

604
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,839
I minimized the importance of the statue
that was dedicated to Nellie Bly...

605
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,076
...an extraordinary woman
to whom we owe a great deal.

606
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,397
-You don't know who she is, do you?
-This isn't happening to me.

607
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,159
She pioneered investigative journalism.

608
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,039
I wanna beat the crap out of her.

609
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,915
She risked her life by having herself
committed to a mental institution...

610
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,276
...for 1 0 days,
so she could write about it.

611
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,996
She changed, entirely, the way
we treat the mentally ill in this country.

612
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,872
-Abigail--
-ln 1 890, she traveled...

613
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,119
...around the world in 72 days, six hours,
1 1 minutes and 1 4 seconds.

614
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,597
Besting by more than one week
Jules Verne's 80 days.

615
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,199
She sounds like
an incredible woman.

616
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,591
I'm impressed that she beat
a fictional record.

617
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,077
If she goes 21,000 leagues under the
sea, I'll name a damn school after her.

618
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,993
-Let's have sex.
-When it comes...

619
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,836
...to historical figures being
memorialized in this country...

620
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,796
...women have been largely overlooked.
Nellie Bly is just the tip of the iceberg.

621
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,038
I couldn't possibly hear
about the rest of the iceberg now.

622
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,993
Elizabeth Blackwell
was the first American woman...

623
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,549
...to be awarded an M. D.

624
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,876
She founded the Women's
Medical College.

625
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,752
Keep talking.
I'll sit here and think...

626
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,713
...about plutonium
and the things I can do with it.

627
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,235
"Brown v. Invisible Empire,
Knights of the Klu Klux Klan.

628
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,556
The court found for the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference...

629
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,478
...and the marchers attacked
in Decatur. "

630
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,679
" Vietnamese Fisherman 's Association
v. The Knights of the KKK.

631
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,918
Civil action enjoining the Klan
from operating a T exas army. "

632
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,873
They shut them down.
"Donald v. United Klans of America.

633
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,555
A suit on behalf of a black youth
who was lynched. "

634
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,353
The jury returned
a 7-million-dollar verdict...

635
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,479
...and deeded the headquarters
to the mother. Court took the Bat Cave.

636
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,996
-Here's the thing. It's not just--
-Hang on.

637
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,999
-I'm kind of caught--
-Hang on a second.

638
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,519
Did you talk to Steve Joyce
and Mark Brookline?

639
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,869
-Yes, I did.
-I was told...

640
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,874
...you would be working
in the Majority Counsel's Office...

641
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,555
...but it's my understanding
I'd be talking to Brookline and Joyce...

642
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,796
...seeing as how they work for me.

643
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,195
I was taking initiative.

644
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,630
Well, wasn't that spunky of you.

645
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,313
Sam, do you think there's any chance
that you could be rude to me tomorrow?

646
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,999
T omorrow is Saturday.
I will be here.

647
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,950
You can call me and be rude by phone,
or you can stop by and do it in person.

648
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,829
If I have to endure
another disappointment today...

649
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,556
...from this place that I have
worshipped, I am gonna lose it.

650
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,396
So if you could wait until tomorrow,
I would appreciate it.

651
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,752
Anyway....

652
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,995
The jury returned
a 7-million-dollar--

653
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,950
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

654
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,958
Ainsley?

655
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,350
Look, can I talk to you for a minute?

656
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,395
All I was really trying to say--

657
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,959
Who did this?

658
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,833
Who did this?

659
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,835
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

660
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,992
-Don't worry about it.
-Who sent this?

661
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,759
-Don't worry about it.
-Ainsley.

662
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,189
Sam....

663
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,675
How did your meeting go
with Brookline and Joyce?

664
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,794
It went great. I talked to them for
a couple of minutes, and I think that--

665
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,715
Sam!

666
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,116
Did anybody order a pizza?
And if they didn't, could they do it now?

667
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,753
You know what, guys?

668
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,713
When I write something,
I sign my name.

669
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,430
Here, I'll show you.

670
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,235
You have any idea how big of a
harassment suit you just exposed us to?

671
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,679
She just--

672
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,113
She works here.

673
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,839
Which is more than I can say
for either one of you.

674
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,070
"You're fired.
S. Seaborn. "

675
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,352
I don't know who you think you
are around here, you can't fire us.

676
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,119
Oh, yes.

677
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,874
He can.

678
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,636
Leave here,
and don't ever come back.

679
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,193
It's time for both of you
to write your book now.

680
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,108
Lionel?

681
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,078
What are you looking at?

682
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,552
I'm-- Nothing.

683
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,916
I'm not--

684
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,599
Nothing.

685
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,873
Except it's from Pinafore.

686
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,351
-It's from Penzance.
-Hate to stick my head...

687
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,993
...in the lion's mouth,
but I gotta ask:

688
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,597
Were you the secretary of the Princeton
Gilbert and Sullivan Society?

689
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,871
-No, but then again, I'm not a woman.
-I'm just--

690
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,033
Little drinks, I'm supposed
to be having right now.

691
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,833
Umbrellas sticking out of them.

692
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,156
Shish kebab!

693
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,752
"Belva Lockwood, for instance,
the first woman to practice law.

694
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,953
She argued a case in front
of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1 879...

695
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,470
...decades before she'd have
the right to vote.

696
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,911
Ellen Swallow Richards, the first woman
to be a professional chemist.

697
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,597
Maria Mitchell,
who discovered a comet in 1 847...

698
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,872
...and was the first woman admitted
to the Academy of Arts and Sciences.

699
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,352
I could go on and on
and on and on.

700
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,313
The fact remains that of the monuments
built with public money...

701
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,349
...only 50 of them pay tribute to the
women who helped build this country...

702
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,792
...and open its doors to all
our daughters who would follow.

703
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,117
In the coming months, I'll try
to persuade Congress to rectify that.

704
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,915
In the meantime, enjoy your weekend.
God bless you, and God bless America. "

705
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,510
-We're out.
-Do it live. That's what I always say.

706
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,837
-Very nice, babe.
-By the way, the Statue of Liberty.

707
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,509
-Get upstairs.
-At the front door to the country.

708
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,949
-Upstairs!
-Like a lawn jockey.

709
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,111
Mr. President?

710
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,068
C.J., the president's gonna take
a personal staff time now.

711
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,471
No, it's okay.
I'll be right behind you.

712
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,352
-Special garment.
-Go.

713
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,350
-Mr. President?
-ls this about Ed Barrie?

714
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,353
Yes, it is.

715
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,915
-I wanted to ask--
-Go ahead, let him out of the box.

716
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,949
Say what you want about Barrie,
and I can say plenty.

717
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,954
He was the first one in
and the last one out of a war...

718
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,878
...that I didn't want
anything to do with.

719
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,675
The man's earned the right
to say whatever he wants.

720
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,678
Let him out of the box, would you?

721
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,836
Yes, sir.

722
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,473
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

723
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,159
I'm out of here.

724
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,153
It ties up the staff indefinitely
when there are--

725
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,596
There are other things
they should be doing.

726
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,952
I'd appear to be using a high-profile
position for my personal agenda.

727
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,835
But mostly, I just think
a lawsuit is too small.

728
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,313
I can't have it be like I slipped
in their driveway.

729
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,352
It's different than that to me.

730
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,839
I don't wanna sue them.

731
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,079
Okay.

732
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,191
-And the insurance company?
-Them, I'll sue. No problem.

733
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,191
We're on our way.

734
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,792
-She's here.
-Let's go.

735
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,033
Hello?

736
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,874
Hello?

737
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,316
Thank you.
