00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,032
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,231
The president will announce
a BIue Ribbon Commission...

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,034
...to study the Iong-term future
of entitlement programs.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,633
-We want you to go to a meeting.
-With who?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,434
-A Democrat on the Ethics Committee.
-A date with my ex-wife?

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,908
-Sit next to me.
-I'm a responsible adult.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,832
I'm a member of the U.S. Congress.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,431
Doe's the White House make
a crusade out of defending...

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,119
-...the rights of drug users?
-PIease.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,791
We have questions about drug use,
marijuana in particular.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,912
Jersey Girl wants to know
if marijuana can make you sterile.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,430
Is this Jersey Girl asking the question
or Jersey Boyfriend?

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,517
-Both.
-Okay.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,315
Well, there's no evidence so far
that marijuana has a permanent effect...

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,556
...on the male or female
reproductive systems.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,914
A few studies have suggested
that heavy marijuana use...

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,829
... may have an effect
on male testicular function...

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,917
... but that effect would be reversible.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,636
So if Jersey Boyfriend is concerned,
he should mention it to his doctor.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,310
Pixaladd wants to know
if marijuana can cause cancer.

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,637
No conclusive study to date
has shown that it doe's.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,230
However, and this is a big however...

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,637
...cellular genetic and human studies
all suggest...

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,233
...that the smoke from pot is a risk factor
in acquiring respiratory disease.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,638
If Pixaladd wants to be able to walk up
a flight of stairs without throwing up...

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,717
... he should put the bong
in the closet...

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,435
... behind the AIIman Brothers albums
where it belongs.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,839
Josh. What the hell kind of name
is Pixaladd? Josh?

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,234
-I'm done.
-Yeah?

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,919
-Efficiency, Donna.
-Y eah.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,159
Efficiency and professionalism, and we' re
out of here at 9:00 on Wednesday night.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,237
It doe'sn't hurt the president's in T okyo.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,115
There doe's seem to be Iess work to do
when he's in a different hemisphere.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,311
-But nonetheless....
-Efficiency and professionalism.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,715
With a healthy dollop
of Ieadership skills.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,751
The well-placed, well-worded memo.

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,713
Nobody goes off the reservation.
Everybody doe's their job.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,912
-T urn off your computer. Let's go.
-No, I'm gonna watch this.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,712
-Maybe you should too.
-What is it?

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,831
The surgeon general's doing
an online chat.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,429
-What's she talking about?
-Decriminalizing marijuana.

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,596
See you tomorrow.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,239
What's she talking about?

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,432
" Do you favor the decriminalization
of marijuana? "

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,710
" It's not for me to say.
I can say marijuana...

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,912
... poses no greater public health risk
than nicotine or alcohol. "

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,237
" It doe'sn't share the same addictive
properties as heroin and LSD. "

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,830
"Y et bizarrely to many of us
in the health care profession...

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,828
...the Iaw categorizes it
as a Schedule 1 narcotic...

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,795
...while putting a government seal
on a pack of cigarettes. "

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,795
Y eah, somebody didn't get your memo.

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,072
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,799
-Take a Iook at this.
-What is it?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,869
It's a transcript of an online chat
Millicent Griffith just did. Page eight.

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,993
-Toby's headed in. Sam's on the phone.
-I can't talk now.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,872
-He says it's important.
-In a minute.

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,116
-The AIIman Brothers?
-It gets a Iot worse.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,235
" Marijuana poses no greater public
health risk than nicotine or alcohol. "

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,113
" Doe'sn't share the same
addictive properties as--"

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,756
" Bizarrely categorizes it as--"
And... I quit.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,951
-Let's go.
-Is she kidding me with this?

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,232
-When did it happen?
-She just finished. T alk me through this.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,228
These people got a story. They called
AP already. Carol, get me the wires.

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,910
It's too Iate for the Times and Post,
but L.A. and San Francisco'II have it.

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,829
It'II be above the fold. The Today Show'II
Iead with it. Russert will do a segment.

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,110
-Toby!
-Guys, I'm in the BIue Ribbon meeting.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,914
I got Iabor yelling at me.
I got a situation developing.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,031
We've got a situation developing here.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,195
-What?
-Read that.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,437
-Page eight. Why didn't you call me?
-While it was happening?

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,517
-So you could do what?
-When did it happen?

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,597
She finished about 5 or 1 0 minutes ago.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,109
You saw it happen?
Why didn't you get me?

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,799
-What would you do?
-End it.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,115
-How?
-By ending it.

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,072
-Listen, something's happened.
-We know.

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,197
-How?
-Josh was watching it in real time.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,635
I'm not gonna belay
into the computer screen.

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,757
-What are you talking about?
-Surgeon general. You?

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,037
-Never mind. What did she do?
-Reversed our position on marijuana.

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,111
AII right, what time is it in T okyo?

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,117
-They' re 1 4 hours ahead.
-I thought 1 3.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,117
-Eastern Daylight.
-So it's 1 4 hours ahead?

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,233
-We're sure it's ahead, not behind?
-Guys, there are clocks on the wall.

85
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,114
-Okay, so it's almost 1 1 :00 in T okyo.
-Y es.

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,635
-Ginger. Get Larry and Ed.
-Anybody in my office.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,353
We'II be in the Roosevelt Room.

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,630
Sorry, 1 1 in the morning,
1 1 in the afternoon?

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,034
It's 1 1 a. m.

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,912
-The AIIman Brothers?
-Keep reading.

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,873
If it's not a story until tomorrow morning,
they'II have it tomorrow night.

92
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,274
-We bought a day.
-Two days.

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,709
-How?
-PIane ride.

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,512
-When's he Ieave?
-7 p. m. Thursday.

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,035
-T omorrow? Local time?
-Which, theirs or ours?

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,549
It will be 7 p. m. Thursday in Japan
when he Ieaves.

97
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,717
And he Iands here when?

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,909
-The flight is 1 3 hours Iong.
-This isn't happening.

99
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,628
He'II travel eastward from T okyo,
Ieaving at 7 p. m.

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,637
When he crosses
the International Date Line--

101
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,518
-He'II travel back in time to what?
-3 a. m.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,836
Which puts him in Washington
6 p. m. Thursday.

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,237
He's gonna Iand in Washington
an hour before he took off?

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,675
That story doe'sn't beat
the surgeon general?

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,797
Toby, they' re calling for you over there.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,639
I'm gonna go get yelled at some more.
Josh, get Leo.

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,910
-Call T okyo.
-Y eah.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,917
-Carol's got the wires.
-Thanks.

109
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,033
-Those clocks should be in military time.
-Yeah, because that's Iess confusing.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,835
The man's gone 1 50 hours.
How can it be Thursday the whole time?

111
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,316
Listen, Japan is 9 hours ahead
of Greenwich Mean Time--

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,158
-Don't.
-Sophie, this is Donna Moss.

113
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,113
-Locate the chief of staff.
-What were you talking about before?

114
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,914
I've been told by someone I believe
that a full-page ad...

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,270
...taken out by the Family Values
Leadership Council...

116
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,630
...is going to appear
in 22 newspapers tomorrow.

117
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,354
It Iists many prominent people
and congratulates them...

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,676
...for denouncing the movie
Prince of New York.

119
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,031
-So, what's the problem?
-They congratulate the president.

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,794
The president denounced it?
Then how can they run that?

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,998
I have no idea. But I don't Iike
who we'rebeing congratulated by.

122
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,231
-Josh.
-Y eah.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,638
Y eah, Leo, we got a couple
of problems here.

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,109
-I'm here.
-Thanks.

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,436
-We're doing this again?
-Yeah.

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,518
Because I just got you off
that Iittle bellman's thing.

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,199
Here's my problem.

128
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,228
AARP and AFL-CIO want the president
to put Seth Gillette on the commission.

129
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,034
It's important to them,
so it's gotta be important to us.

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,719
-There's another reason.
-It neutralizes him.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,191
-He can't attack it if he's on it.
-Which is why if we ask, he'II say no.

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,237
-Maybe, maybe not.
-We can't risk that.

133
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,714
We need him on the commission...

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,559
...or Iabor and seniors'II be
suspicious from the get-go.

135
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,308
If he's not on it, it can't be
because he turned us down.

136
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,312
Either we get him on,
or if we don't...

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,909
...we make sure it's
because we never asked him.

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,712
Yeah.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,718
-Sam, he's on the phone.
-Thanks.

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,071
-I don't know the answer to that.
-Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,596
Yeah.

142
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,033
Charlie.

143
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,075
Yeah, listen.

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,034
Did you have a phone conversation with
a movie producer named Morgan Ross?

145
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,312
-Y eah, Iast week.
-Can you tell me about that conversation?

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,829
-He 's got a movie coming out.
-Prince of New York.

147
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,877
They wanted to screen it
at the White House.

148
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,314
What did you say?

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,511
They sent me the print,
and I looked at it.

150
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,631
-And you passed?
-Y eah.

151
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,433
-Was the president involved in that at all?
-No. He lets me choose the movies.

152
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,156
I just didn 't think he 'd like it,
so I got Dial M for Murder instead. Sam?

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,839
Okay.

154
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,919
Yeah.

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,430
Well, there'd be fallout from women
voters and I'm pretty sure the AMA...

156
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,835
...to say nothing of the first Iady.

157
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,678
-Y eah.
-Leo?

158
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,031
I got nine people on a conference call
at several points of Iongitude.

159
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,639
-When's your first briefing?
-An hour.

160
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,718
Can you support the surgeon general
without supporting her policy?

161
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,592
-Show me.
-T ry me.

162
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,839
Did you know Dr. Griffith would criticize
the administration's drug policy?

163
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,996
I don't agree with your characterization
of her comments.

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,272
She expressed her opinion about
the health effects of illegal drugs.

165
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,836
She called for the Iegalization of
marijuana. Doe's the president agree?

166
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,230
Wrong again, and I'd refer you
to her comments.

167
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,318
When asked if marijuana
should be Iegalized, she said:

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,399
" It's not for me to say. " She's right, and
it's important people understand this.

169
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,916
She is not a Iawmaker. She doe'sn't
set drug policy. The president doe's.

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,829
And the president is 100 percent against
Iegalizing drugs, including marijuana.

171
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,190
Yeah.

172
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,116
Leo, I can take it to the next step.

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,033
Okay.

174
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,953
Okay.

175
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,469
-Leo wants me to show her support?
-Y eah.

176
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,635
-Josh?
-Y eah.

177
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,638
While I'm showing her support,
what are you showing her?

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,990
The door.

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,312
-Good morning.
-C.J.!

180
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,475
Hang on. Katie?

181
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,514
Did you know the surgeon general
would criticize the drug policy last night?

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,518
I disagree with your characterization
of her comments.

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,315
She expressed her opinion about
the health effects of certain illegal drugs.

184
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,511
I'm sorry, but didn 't she say that she--?

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,508
Actually, what she said, and I quote, is
that there 's been no conclusive study....

186
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,836
Josh?

187
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,235
Dr. Griffith.

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,431
You wanna come in?

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,392
Y eah.

190
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,034
-How have you been feeling?
-I've been feeling fine.

191
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,037
Checking your blood pressure
once a week?

192
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,038
Y eah, 1 30/87.

193
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,038
It's a Iittle high.
What about the right Ieg and arm?

194
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,639
There's a Iittle stiffness.

195
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,029
Y eah. You know, the guys at GW did
a fantastic job. It's a beautiful scar.

196
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,435
-When have you seen my scar?
-At the hospital.

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,437
-I don't remember.
-You were unconscious.

198
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,029
-How about your back?
-There's some pain.

199
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,834
-It's in your head.
-AIong with all manner of things.

200
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,237
You know, Josh, just because
the white supremacists didn't kill you...

201
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,908
-...doe'sn't mean that crap you eat won't.
-I eat fine.

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,951
You eat Iike you' re still in college.

203
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,430
-I was in great shape in college.
-You were 1 9.

204
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,835
You could eat T upperware
and deal with it.

205
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,430
Millicent, what were you thinking about?

206
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,110
-I was asked a question, Josh.
-I understand, but your answers--

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,312
My answers were correct, is anyone
challenging me on the facts?

208
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,312
-Not yet.
-Well, they won't.

209
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,671
As a doctor, I have an obligation
to tell the truth.

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,838
Come to think of it, as a person,
I have that obligation as well.

211
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,828
The truth is different if you' re a GP or
a member of the Stanford Faculty CIub...

212
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,600
...than if you' re the country's
chief medical practitioner.

213
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,837
Well, no, I think truth is
pretty much truth across the board...

214
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,918
... never more so than if you' re the
country's chief medical practitioner.

215
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,312
Did you know that 69 percent
of Americans oppose Iegalization?

216
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,754
Only 23 percent support it.

217
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,236
The number gets a Iot higher than that
if you ask people under 30.

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,829
That's a shock.
The number gets even higher...

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,828
...if you Iimit the polling sample
to Bob Marley and the Wailers.

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,919
I mention that age group because an
awful Iot of them seem to be in prison.

221
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,153
Is that what this is about? The criminal
justice system is not your jurisdiction!

222
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,436
-I wasn't commenting on it.
-Millicent!

223
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
-I wasn't commenting on it!
-"Yet bizarrely...

224
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,113
...the Iaw categorizes it
as a Schedule 1 narcotic. "

225
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,393
I was commenting on medicine.

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,033
I've had three conversations
with Leo McGarry in the Iast 1 2 hours.

227
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,310
-The reason I'm here--
-I'm not a politician...

228
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,829
... but it's not Iike I haven't
Iived here two years.

229
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,634
C.J. 's up there right now
giving you our support.

230
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,595
I'm sorry, but we need you to resign.

231
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,593
No.

232
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,191
Dr. Griffith, I say this
with all possible respect...

233
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,196
... but you serve at the pleasure
of the president.

234
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,999
And I'II continue to right up
until the moment he fires me.

235
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,037
Okay.

236
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,792
Thank you, ma'am.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,399
Josh.

238
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,194
See the doctor, get a Iollipop.

239
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,115
The fact that the president disagrees with
her doe'sn 't mean he 's gonna fire her.

240
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,436
The surgeon general's
an executive appointee...

241
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,234
-... and the president stands by his staff.
-Excellent.

242
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,228
C. J., shifting gears, there 's a full-page
ad that appears in today 's Times.

243
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,432
I ' ve been told it might' ve appeared
in 22 papers this morning.

244
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,518
The ad was taken out by
the Family Values Leadership Council...

245
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,234
...and praises the president
for denouncing a movie...

246
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,317
...opening next week,
Prince of New York.

247
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,317
-Y es.
-You know anything about it?

248
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,431
No, I don't know what's going on there.

249
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,837
-The president didn't denounce it?
-Not unless he did it in the shower.

250
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,235
He hasn't denounced it to me
or to the public.

251
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,237
That's all. I'II see you this afternoon.

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,032
-Sam's here.
-Thank you.

253
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,035
-Good job.
-T ell me what's going on with this movie.

254
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,832
-It's called Prince of NeW York.
-Right.

255
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,031
-There's been controversy.
-Sex and violence?

256
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,710
And religious imagery. Religious groups
are organizing boycotts.

257
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,037
The studio phones Charlie because
they want a screening. He passes.

258
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,832
-Why?
-Because he did.

259
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,838
The producer goes on Imus
and says Bartlet's a coward...

260
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,919
...who's siding with censors and that
he's no friend of the First Amendment.

261
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,033
The Family Values Leadership Council
took out an ad congratulating us for that?

262
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,118
-Y eah.
-Seriously, I quit.

263
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,035
-Here it is: We've got these people--
-Wait.

264
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,629
-We've got the industry people.
-It's Morgan Ross' movie?

265
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,115
-Y es. We've got these--
-Morgan Ross went on Imus?

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,039
-He did it by phone.
-He called the president a coward?

267
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,118
He didn't call him a coward as much
as he called him cowardly.

268
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,833
-Which is different.
-How?

269
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,837
-It's not, but still.
-I'II crush him.

270
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,918
This guy's trying to get free media
by screwing with us.

271
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,429
I'm the enforcer, Sam.
I'm gonna crush him.

272
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,234
I'II make him cry
and then I'II tell his mama about it.

273
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,074
-You won't make him cry.
-You wanna watch me make him cry?

274
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,632
I believe you can make him cry.
I'm saying you won't do it.

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm trying to tell you,
we'remeeting with them tomorrow.

276
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,871
I'II straighten it out. Keep telling
the press you don't know anything.

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,437
-That shouldn't be a problem.
-C.J., Danny Concannon's on the phone.

278
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,471
-And I think you should take it.
-Why?

279
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,717
He wants the president's reaction to
a comment made about Millicent Griffith.

280
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,117
-Who made the comment?
-That's the thing. It was EIeanor.

281
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,238
-EIeanor who?
-It was EIeanor Bartlet.

282
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,231
Hey, it's C.J.

283
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,436
Toby, we understand your predicament...

284
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,710
... but the commission won't be credible
with our people...

285
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,912
... unless they know there's someone
on it who's a friend of Iabor.

286
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,235
And a friend of seniors.

287
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,034
The president's a friend of Iabor,
seniors, small animals.

288
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,629
-Toby.
-I'm running out of time, Lenny.

289
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,115
We announced this at the State
of the Union. We gotta get going.

290
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,038
The State of the Union's your problem.

291
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,639
-Nobody brought us in.
-Yes.

292
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,116
And I, for one, am not sure I see a need
for emergency-Iike speed.

293
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,231
-Really?
-If economic conditions continue--

294
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,908
Forever? If we never have
another recession ever again?

295
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,714
The fund can withstand 30 years
before going bankrupt.

296
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,476
Unfortunately, the actuarial tables say
I won't be dead yet.

297
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,513
Guys, Gillette's a tough needle
to thread.

298
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,632
I wanna know that we have your trust,
that whoever we do get...

299
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,470
...will Iook out for your interests, and
that you will support the commission.

300
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,116
Can I assume from your total silence
and blank faces that you' re all with me?

301
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,551
-Maybe if we talk some more.
-Oh, could we?

302
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,716
-C.J., Iisten.
-She didn't?

303
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,512
No. Leo's gonna need to talk to her.

304
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,871
You should start to walk back some
of what you said in the Press Room.

305
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,753
There's something stickier
than the support I gave her.

306
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,269
-What?
-Concannon's quoting EIeanor Bartlet.

307
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,950
She said, " My father won't fire the
surgeon general. He'd never do that. "

308
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,593
-EIeanor?
-Y eah.

309
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,076
-You mean Zoey.
-No, it was EIeanor.

310
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,317
They' re trying to export their way
out of their own economic problems.

311
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,988
-Y es, sir.
-By dumping cheap steel on the U.S...

312
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,031
-...you know what they want?
-A protectionist response.

313
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,708
They' re begging for
a protectionist response.

314
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,275
Steel and mining employ
1 70,000 workers.

315
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,438
They won't sit around while
discount steel comes flying in from--

316
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,189
How you doing? They'II want retaliatory
tariffs, and you know what that means?

317
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,312
A return to Smoot-Hawley
and the Great Depression.

318
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,511
You should go to Japan
and tell them that.

319
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,314
-Charlie.
-Sir.

320
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,432
I'm walking to the press
and telling them retaliatory tariffs...

321
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,235
...are gonna cost American taxpayers
$800,000 for every job saved.

322
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,635
We're not taking questions.
Let's get in the car.

323
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,034
What's going on?

324
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,437
EIeanor made a comment on the record,
and you can't answer questions.

325
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,315
-EIeanor? You mean Zoey.
-It was EIeanor.

326
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,909
-When did this happen?
-About six hours ago.

327
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,111
Why didn't you tell me six hours ago?

328
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,189
Because I didn't want you crash-Ianding
the plane. Let's get in the car.

329
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,868
Welcome back, Mr. President.

330
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,955
Josh, is there anything to suggest
there are people who would smoke pot...

331
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,111
-... but don't because it's illegal?
-No.

332
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,753
Why do you think
if it were decriminalized...

333
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,235
...suddenly people would show up
to work stoned...

334
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,910
...dragging down the economy and
clearing stores of Pringles and Twinkies?

335
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,838
That's not a reason to make it Iegal.

336
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,430
In a free society, you need a reason
to make something illegal, not Iegal.

337
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,791
Parents are keeping drugs away
from their kids with a whip and chair.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,228
-It doe'sn't help if--
-Yeah.

339
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,431
Oh, that's okay. It's just me talking.

340
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,834
The president's back.

341
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,600
-Doe's he wanna see me?
-Yeah.

342
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,114
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

343
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,515
-I've had it, C.J. I've absolutely had it!
-Sir--

344
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,836
What is Danny Concannon
doing calling my kids?

345
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,110
They all know better,
but Danny--

346
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,914
-Sir, he didn't--
-You're gonna suspend his credentials...

347
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,712
...for six months, and I don't care!

348
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,229
His paper wants to cover me,
send someone else.

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,789
Mr. President, Danny didn't call her.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,630
-I was told it was Danny.
-Yes, sir, she called him.

351
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,600
She called him?

352
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,791
Good evening, welcome back,
Mr. President.

353
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,473
The AIIman Brothers, Josh?

354
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,429
How was the flight, sir?

355
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,632
T okyo is willing to show
economic restraint...

356
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,789
...in exchange for a good-fielding
shortstop and a Ieft-handed reliever.

357
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,314
Who's against her so far?

358
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,990
The Judiciary Committee, Government
Reform and Oversight, Appropriations--

359
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,475
-Why Appropriations?
-They control her budget.

360
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,838
-Who's coming to her defense?
-The Cannabis Society...

361
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,508
...the Cannabis Coalition,
E Cannabis Unum...

362
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,429
...The American Hemp League
and Friends of Mary Jane.

363
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,959
-Sir?
-Y eah.

364
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,317
-Sam's waiting to see you.
-I understand I've been congratulated...

365
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,636
...for denouncing a movie
I've never heard of.

366
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,512
-Y es.
-I've gotta hand it to you.

367
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,474
You pulled off a political first. You won
me the support of the Christian right...

368
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,752
...and the Cheech and Chong Fan CIub
in the same day.

369
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,439
Leo's seeing her tomorrow.

370
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,392
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

371
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,798
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

372
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,790
Charlie?

373
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,832
Would you arrange for my middle
daughter to come see me...

374
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,271
-...at her earliest possible convenience?
-Y es, sir.

375
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,190
Screw her convenience.
Get her ass down here.

376
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,831
Y eah?

377
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,439
-What's this note?
-That note?

378
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,629
Y eah.

379
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,717
It says we should stand by
the surgeon general.

380
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,992
Actually, it says we should stand by
the "sturgeon" general.

381
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,519
-Doe's it?
-Y eah.

382
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,712
-I meant surgeon general.
-I think we should stand by her too.

383
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,230
I wanted to make sure we were agreed
smoked whitefish was on its own.

384
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,435
-Y eah.
-Toby?

385
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,751
-She's here?
-In the Iobby.

386
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,630
-You're with the ratings people?
-Soon. What's the food for?

387
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,673
-T oday's attempt at insuring our future.
-What's your plan?

388
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,713
First, I have to be nice to
a Iiberal Democratic congresswoman.

389
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,310
-Will that be hard?
-Well, it was when I was married to her.

390
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,715
-Hey.
-Good to see you. Thanks for coming.

391
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,512
You Iook fantastic.

392
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,234
-Thank you. How've you been, Sam?
-Sam's great.

393
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,829
Fit as a fiddle, Andy.
AIthough, I found--

394
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,439
Nobody cares.

395
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,710
Yeah.

396
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,911
Hi.

397
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,829
-How you doing?
-Congresswoman Wyatt.

398
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,316
-Yes, indeed.
-You're growing into that title nicely.

399
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,829
This is going someplace hysterical.

400
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,237
Y eah. Labor wants Gillette
on the commission.

401
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,032
-Y es.
-So doe's the AARP.

402
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,355
-Y es.
-It's important.

403
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,629
-Y es.
-You know why?

404
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,592
They' re suspicious of the commission...

405
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,631
...and want one of their people
protecting them.

406
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,836
We're one of their people.

407
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,510
Has it been easy convincing them of that
since you announced the commission?

408
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,236
No. But I bring you here.
And we sit and we have coffee...

409
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,670
...and we have Danish
in the hope that calmer...

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,634
-...and, dare I say, prettier heads prevail.
-How I miss patronizing, sexist Toby.

411
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,115
I was referring to myself.

412
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,912
-You don't wanna ask Gillette.
-Nope.

413
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,509
-Because you think he might say no.
-Right.

414
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,076
This is really important, Andy.
Can you help us?

415
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,312
No.

416
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,709
Toby?

417
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,388
CIose the door.

418
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,590
Put the Danish down.

419
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,829
-Dial M?
-Y eah.

420
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,837
-A fine film.
-I know it well.

421
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,032
Ray Milland, Grace Kelly,
Robert Cummings--

422
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,516
-He Iikes when the guy Iooks for the key.
-What was the other one about?

423
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,869
-Prince of New York?
-Y eah.

424
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,640
It's an updated version
of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot...

425
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,515
... "which tells the story of a Christlike
epileptic man who embodies goodness...

426
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,109
... but encounters sex, crime
and family dysfunction. "

427
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,709
I can't imagine why you didn't think
he'd enjoy that.

428
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,639
He would've enjoyed the scene
where Prince Myshkin...

429
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,435
... has a seizure while engaged in
an erotic fantasy in a Long Island church.

430
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,029
PIease don't say the word "erotic"
in the Oval Office.

431
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,913
I'd be happy never to say
any of those words anywhere again.

432
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,917
John Williams
as Chief Inspector Hubbard.

433
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,429
-Not to mention--
-Excuse me.

434
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,437
EIIie.

435
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,518
I was told my father wanted to see me.

436
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,430
Let me ask you this. Red meat has been
found to cause cancer in white rats.

437
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,632
Maraschino cherries have been
found to cause cancer in white rats.

438
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,400
Cellular phones were found
to cause cancer in white rats.

439
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,037
Has anyone examined the possibility that
cancer might be hereditary in white rats?

440
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,118
Let me tell you, I'm not 100 percent sure
we've ruled that out.

441
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,629
Dr. Griffith.

442
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,070
I'm on.

443
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,712
Congratulations, Millie.

444
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,038
You're now the pamphlet girl for
every right-wing fundraising cause.

445
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,949
That interview's gotta be worth at Ieast
20, 30 million bucks in contributions...

446
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,436
...from people who think you'II distribute
dime bags of Hawaiian sens...

447
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,633
...at junior high schools, along with
condoms and fornication manuals.

448
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,877
Can I say, I was never given
a fornication manual, so....

449
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,874
-You think this is funny?
-We're spending a billion dollars a year...

450
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,469
... keeping more than 40,000 people
Iocked up.

451
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,750
-That's not your--
-That's not my jurisdiction.

452
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,474
Which is why I didn't comment
on decriminalization.

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,759
Six committee chairs, three House, three
Senate, are all talking about hearings.

454
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,428
-What will they find?
-They don't need to find anything.

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,276
They need to say your name and "drugs"
as many times as possible on television.

456
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,836
I don't think you said anything wrong.
Nobody thinks you did anything wrong.

457
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,634
I'd Iike to do the right thing
all the time, but I can't.

458
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,308
I can't Iet us get bogged down.
Government'II stop.

459
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,796
This'II be what we do for two months.
There are more important things.

460
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,635
I'II take heat from the first Iady, but
I want your resignation by 8 tonight...

461
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,873
...or the president's gonna fire you.
I've got a meeting.

462
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,596
Thanks.

463
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,237
Zoey said you were thinking
about oncology.

464
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,429
Excuse me?

465
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,597
Zoey said you were thinking
about oncology.

466
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,918
Yeah, or neurology.

467
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,839
-He's just tied up in his meeting.
-I'm fine.

468
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,830
-They said he'd be back any minute.
-I'm-- Good, yeah.

469
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,395
You Iike medical school?

470
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,119
I do.

471
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,311
I Iike my professors.

472
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,757
I have a pathophysiology professor
who teaches clinical skills by--

473
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,955
Eagle's moving.

474
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,237
Eight hundred thousand dollars
in consumer costs per job saved.

475
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,830
Retaliatory tariffs on steel imports
are a disaster.

476
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,838
Anyone wants to check my math,
they' re more than welcome to.

477
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,793
Anybody wants to shove
the Golden Gate Bridge up Japan's ass...

478
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,514
-...they' re welcome to do that too.
-Mr. President?

479
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,996
-Thank you.
-Y es, sir.

480
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,193
-EIIie, thanks for coming.
-Hi, Dad.

481
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,514
Come on in.

482
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,839
-Did you get down here okay?
-Y eah.

483
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,917
Did you take an airplane?

484
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,235
-An airplane?
-Y eah.

485
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,032
-No.
-Helicopter?

486
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,639
No, the agents drove me.

487
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,519
That's because you go to school
at Johns Hopkins, right?

488
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,632
-Dad.
-And Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore.

489
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,674
I'm asking because Baltimore's
a 45-minute car ride from Washington...

490
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,433
...and we hardly see you anymore.

491
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,712
So I thought either you transferred
to a different medical school...

492
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,309
...they moved Johns Hopkins
or they moved Baltimore.

493
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,636
-Are any of those things true?
-No.

494
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,711
Okay. And this is accurate, this quote?

495
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,869
" My father won't fire the surgeon
general. He would never do that. "

496
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,035
Y es.

497
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,232
When you put your head down,
your hair falls in your face...

498
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,715
...and I can't see your face
or hear you.

499
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,718
Now, Iook at me and talk to me!

500
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,672
Y es, the quote is accurate.

501
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,229
What the hell are you doing
talking to a reporter?

502
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,273
-I was--
-I set up monumental, unprecedented...

503
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,114
... unbreakable rules
about my children and the press.

504
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,279
I've gotten White House reporters
transferred to Y emen...

505
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,678
...for approaching Zoey and EIizabeth.
It is the Iaw!

506
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,156
Well, I'm sure before you gave
the quote...

507
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,237
...you cleared it
with the communications office.

508
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,113
I'm sure you went over
the exact wording with C.J. Cregg...

509
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,550
...and coordinated it
with White House strategy...

510
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,751
...so the timing was right
in the news cycle.

511
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,428
I'm sure you consulted
the appropriate party Ieadership...

512
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,796
... because you' re a pretty
knowledgeable operative...

513
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,116
... having spent so much time
with me. EIIie!

514
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,039
-Dad, she was-- She was--
-What? Pick your head up!

515
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,909
She was doing exactly what
she is supposed to do.

516
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,311
She-- I'm sorry.

517
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,717
She was asked a question,
and she said what she knew to be true.

518
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,718
When you start firing doctors for that,
you've crossed a Iine.

519
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,311
There is politics involved in this, and
you knew it would make me unhappy.

520
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,269
-That's why you did it. That's cheap.
-I didn't do it to make you unhappy.

521
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,796
-You didn't do it to make me happy!
-I don't know how to make you happy.

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,878
For that you gotta talk to Zoey or Liz.

523
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,193
Okay, Iet's drop it.

524
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,709
Mom gets back in the morning and we
have a movie tonight, if you wanna stay.

525
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,229
I can stay over if you want me to.

526
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,874
Yeah, thanks.

527
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,631
I go out...?

528
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,353
That door over there.

529
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,835
-Mr. President?
-Y eah.

530
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,110
-The Iabor secretary.
-Send him in.

531
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,876
Charlie?

532
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,229
-Give me just a minute, would you?
-Y es, sir.

533
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,839
-Andy, Iook.
-Hang on a second.

534
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,439
-Hang on a second!
-No, I won't.

535
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,470
Y es, you will. You will summon your
strength and Iisten to me for a moment.

536
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,475
You made a hairpin turn
at the State of the Union...

537
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,831
...without consulting a Iot of members of
the Iiberal wing of the Democratic Party.

538
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,470
There aren't a Iot of members of the
Iiberal wing of the Democratic Party.

539
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,309
So forgive people if they' re concerned
one of the options you'II explore...

540
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,039
...is raising the retirement age.

541
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,437
Andy, people are Iiving decades Ionger
than anyone anticipated in 1 935.

542
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,870
-So you are?
-We wanna consider everything...

543
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,588
-... but can't consider anything--
-Why doe's this have to be secret?

544
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,673
Because it's the only way
it's gonna happen.

545
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,115
Because you can't solve
Social Security...

546
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,039
...and ask people to run for election
at the same time.

547
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,119
Why not give politicians a cloud cover
and Iet them be Iawmakers for a while?

548
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,351
1 5 people in a room
with the door closed.

549
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,235
Seven Democrats, 7 Republicans and
the president, who will not have a vote.

550
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,591
They walk out, and with one voice,
they make a recommendation...

551
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,314
...to Congress and the American people.

552
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,592
And nobody knows who was where.

553
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,358
The only way it's gonna happen
is in secret.

554
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,710
The only way it'II happen
is if all the sides...

555
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,956
...are confident in their representation.

556
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,516
Otherwise, it's dead. And so I need
Seth Gillette on the commission...

557
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,430
... but I can't ask him. Because if
he says no, there'II be no commission.

558
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,395
Anyway, I appreciate you coming down
and talking to me.

559
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,837
I Iike when you ask for my help, Toby.

560
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,238
I read that I'm on the benefit committee
for the Child Leukemia Foundation.

561
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,034
-Y eah, I saw that too.
-Why did they write that?

562
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,708
They must've gotten it
from the press release I sent.

563
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,912
I guess so. You didn't think
it'd be better to ask me first?

564
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,519
-I really didn't.
-Interesting.

565
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,314
I've found if I skip the first step
and move to the second...

566
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,272
...it becomes harder
for people to say no.

567
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,153
You'II have fun.
You'II Iook nice in your tuxedo.

568
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,039
You don't have to stay.
You don't have--

569
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,831
-Toby?
-Skip over the first step...

570
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,508
...and move right to the second.

571
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,039
Toby.

572
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,514
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey, C.J.

573
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,837
Toby, when you have a minute,
can you stop by the office and....

574
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,632
What?

575
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,432
T omorrow, I want you to announce...

576
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,473
...Gillette's joined the BIue Ribbon
Commission on Social Security.

577
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,239
-Toby--?
-Make sure the press knows...

578
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,234
...the senator put the Democratic Party
above personal differences.

579
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,238
He put people above all.
Make sure they know he's a patriot...

580
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,033
...and when the president asked him to
serve, Senator Gillette answered the call.

581
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,117
-Did he?
-Y eah.

582
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,471
I just saw it at your press briefing
tomorrow morning.

583
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,799
Okay, but this is really the Iast thing
I'm doing before I quit.

584
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,310
Okay.

585
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,315
It's Iike checking sugar and fat content
on cereal.

586
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,034
We bend over backwards
to help parents make choices.

587
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,916
We put V-Chips in TVs, warning Iabels
on records, TV shows, film ads.

588
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,633
And when we do, we suffer...

589
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,513
... because our products become
demonized and marginalized.

590
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,994
Sam Seaborn wants to see you.

591
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,792
Every 1 0 years the government
asks for more.

592
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,436
We come to you every 1 0 years because
the situation isn't getting better.

593
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,710
When will the government ask
the NFL and NHL--?

594
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,353
-Can I talk to you?
-Sure.

595
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,118
-Come on.
-Hey, he's wrong in there.

596
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,914
The situation isn't the same.
There's a 28 percent drop...

597
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,317
...in juvenile crime, 1 0 percent drop
in the overall crime rate.

598
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,238
-I don't care.
-Why?

599
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,513
American Academy of Pediatrics, AMA,
the American Psychological Association...

600
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,269
...say watching violence on TV is bad
for kids, and we'II Iisten to experts.

601
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,631
I'II remember that tomorrow when I
read the surgeon general was fired.

602
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,432
Remember it whenever you Iike.

603
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,710
-What is he seeing tonight?
-Dial M for Murder.

604
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,388
Good. Hitchcock never used sex
or violence in his films.

605
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,995
Yeah. Morgan, the president's
never seen your movie.

606
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,237
He's never heard of it. He has
no objection to it, and you know it.

607
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,635
The Family Values Leadership Council
sees it differently.

608
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,037
The Family Values Leadership Council
distorted the truth.

609
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,151
-Stop the presses.
-Thanks to that ad...

610
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,119
...exhibitors in Mississippi, Oklahoma
and AIabama are pulling the film.

611
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,632
I read the synopsis, and if exhibitors put
you on every screen of every multiplex...

612
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,276
...you still wouldn't do any business
in Mississippi, Oklahoma or AIabama.

613
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,397
-You're an industry expert?
-But you are...

614
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,315
...which explains a Iot about Hollywood.
You knew the ad would get business.

615
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,909
And that's why you went on Imus
and said what you did.

616
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,999
-I'm here for a Sam Seaborn scolding?
-Y eah, because it makes me crazy.

617
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,636
This kind of thing should be celebrated
by First Amendment advocates.

618
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,032
Charlie was offered a choice and made
one. Why aren't you saying:

619
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,629
" It works. Don't ban movies
Iike Prince of NeW York.

620
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,876
You just have to choose
not to watch them "?

621
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,551
And, Morgan...

622
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,519
...you ever call the president
a coward again for PR...

623
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,518
...it won't be C.J. you gotta deal with.
It'II be me.

624
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,393
You understand what I'm saying, right?

625
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,431
Yes.

626
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,191
Go back to your meeting and show me
how much you want to make it up to us.

627
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,793
Good job.

628
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,319
This isn't good.

629
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,717
-What?
-The president's not talking.

630
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,391
-There's a movie on.
-He usually talks during the movie.

631
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,392
Hello?

632
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,715
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Mr. President.

633
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,717
-I'm sorry about this.
-Y es, sir.

634
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,831
-Is that your resignation?
-Y es, sir.

635
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,270
-Thank you.
-On thinking about it...

636
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,040
... I felt your firing me would send
a dangerous signal...

637
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,470
-...to whomever had my job next.
-Did you not think...

638
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,076
...that playing down the dangers
of drug use sent a dangerous signal?

639
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,231
I do not believe that is what I did, sir.

640
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,036
I was asked, by and Iarge, if marijuana
holds the same addictive properties...

641
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,629
...as heroin or LSD. It doe's not.

642
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,231
I was asked if marijuana poses a greater
health risk than nicotine or alcohol.

643
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,431
In my opinion, it doe's not.
If you Iook at--

644
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,837
-Millie, did you put her up to it?
-Sir?

645
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,391
" My father won't fire the surgeon
general. He would never do that. "

646
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,751
You didn't put her up to it?
You didn't pick up the phone and say:

647
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,120
" It's your godmother. Let's stick it to
your dad and paint him into a corner"?

648
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,390
No, sir.

649
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,194
Why haven't I ever been able
to get her to Iike me?

650
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,435
I'm asking you.

651
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,189
-Sir, I'm not sure it's appropriate.
-I'm asking you.

652
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,349
-I think you' re wrong.
-I'm not.

653
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,909
-She worships you, Mr. President.
-She's mad at me.

654
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,917
-You're mad at her.
-Yes, I am.

655
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,315
I was running for president.
Where was she?

656
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,239
-She was with us.
-Not Iike Zoey and Liz.

657
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,318
-Sir--
-She's always belonged to Abbey.

658
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,629
You frightened her.

659
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,989
No, I didn't.

660
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,159
-How did I frighten her?
-Jed, Iook where you' re standing!

661
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,999
I was elected two years ago.
She's 24 years old!

662
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,512
You've been the king of whatever room
you've walked into her entire Iife.

663
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,790
It never seemed to intimidate
Zoey or Liz.

664
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,235
Well, kids are different.
They' re not the same.

665
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,113
You'd be amazed, you'd be stunned...

666
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,029
...at how soon they understand
they' re not their father's favorite.

667
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,673
-That's not true.
-Sir.

668
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,313
-That's not true.
-Mr. President.

669
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,230
No. I will bear with the nonsense of the
Christian right and the Hollywood Ieft...

670
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,513
...and the AFL-CIO and AARP
and the Cannabis Society and Japan...

671
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,234
... but I will not stand and allow
someone to tell me...

672
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,194
...that I Iove one of my children
Iess than the others.

673
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,629
She's frightened of me?

674
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,990
She ain't the only one.

675
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,318
I wanted to be so mad at her.

676
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,990
I heard the news and my first thought....

677
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,029
My God, King Lear is a good play.

678
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,716
" My father won't fire the surgeon
general. He would never do that. "

679
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,837
I wanted to be so mad at her.

680
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,149
But the truth is, it's the nicest thing
she's ever said about me.

681
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,312
Well, good night, sir.

682
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,790
Good night.

683
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,634
-Hey, doc.
-Sir?

684
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,509
I don't accept.

685
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,110
-I'm sorry, sir?
-I don't accept your resignation.

686
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,158
I appreciate that, but Leo's right.

687
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,635
This shouldn't stop you
from doing bigger things.

688
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,833
These are the bigger things.
I don't accept your resignation.

689
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,591
You work for me.
You go when I tell you to.

690
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,510
-You're an excellent role model.
-Y es, I know.

691
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,435
-So you' re back?
-Y es, indeed.

692
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,992
T ell C.J. when she gives Millie
our support on Monday, she can mean it.

693
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,832
It's gonna seem to some people...

694
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,429
...Iike you did it because
your daughter asked you to.

695
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,039
Y eah.

696
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
You know, Josh, I think
if you ever have a daughter...

697
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,310
...you'II discover there are worse reasons
in the world to do something.

698
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,988
-Sit down. We're at the good part.
- What's he doing?

699
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,913
Wondering Why that key doe'sn 't fit.

700
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,795
He 's going around to the back entrance.
He stopped again.

701
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,070
How you doing?

702
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,636
I said, how you doing?

703
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,592
Fine.

704
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,635
-We're coming up to the good part.
-People are trying to watch the movie.

705
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,271
You wanna bet me your tuition no one
in this room is gonna shush me?

706
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,230
I hear you' re thinking
about ophthalmology.

707
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,555
Oncology.

708
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,791
Why do you wanna study people's feet?

709
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,709
-That's podiatry.
-Then what's children's medicine?

710
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,639
-Pediatrics.
-I thought it was obstetrics.

711
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,634
-That's pregnant women.
-And what's the study of feet?

712
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,910
Dad, you' re not gonna get me to Iaugh.

713
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,795
Really?

714
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,911
The only thing you ever had to do
to make me happy...

715
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,634
...was come home at the end of the day.

716
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,839
So endocrinology would be what,
disorders of the gallbladder?

717
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,439
Thyroid.

718
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,519
I'm pretty sure you' re wrong about that.
Endocrinology is your sub-specialty...

719
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,632
...of internal medicine devoted
to the digestive system.

720
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,310
-That would be gastroenterology.
-Are you sure it's not nephrology...

721
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,717
...immunology, cardiology
or dermatology?

722
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,319
Just stop it.
I'm trying to watch the movie.

723
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,158
Okay.

724
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,754
Here comes the good part.
