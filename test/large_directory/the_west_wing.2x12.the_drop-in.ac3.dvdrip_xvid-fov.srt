00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,713
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,399
-He's a Iunatic.
-He's colorful.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,914
-He's certifiable.
-Who?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,075
Lord John Marbury.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,033
You're gonna Iet him Ioose
where there's Iiquor and women?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,629
We can hide the women,
but the man deserves a drink.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,952
AIIow me. Lord John Marbury.
I was summoned by your president.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,913
Yes. We've met 1 0 or 1 2 times.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,111
-Leo McGarry.
-I thought you were the butler.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,118
You're the one who's been saying
we need a radical approach.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,993
Yes, yes, I have. And I got
shouted down in every meeting.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,475
I prefer not to paint a picture
in the interest of oratory.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,749
The year is one week old.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,997
The Iegislative session hasn't begun
and we can't put waffles...

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,111
...in our mouth
without coughing up the ball.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,072
-You got beat.
-Yes.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,032
Figure it out.
Tell me what you'II do.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,718
Are we patched into the Pentagon?

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,875
We can hear them?

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,878
We can hear what they're saying
at Command?

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,195
Why can't I hear anything?

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,597
-Why aren't we hearing anything?
-Fifteen seconds to target launch.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,677
Why don't you just tell me
to shut up--

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,836
We have a target launch sequence.
Go flight.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,519
Kwajalein Atoll, how do you read?

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,678
We read you five by five.
Positive target launch sequence.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,795
-Here we go.
- Target launch in five. Four. Three. Two.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,872
Target is aloft.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,236
-How Iong do I have?
-Two minutes, 1 0 seconds.

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,149
I'm gonna see if I can get
the president to watch this.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,676
-Mr. Sumatra, you' re a sports fan.
-Yes, sir, Mr. President. Golf.

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,359
Okay, well, golf's not a sport.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,189
It's fine, don't get me wrong, but Iet's
not confuse it with things that men do.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,550
-Yes, sir.
-We're going to Bangkok in June.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,875
-June, Charlie?
-Yes, sir.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,355
-You're at the Oriental.
-Best hotel in the world.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,233
James Michener wrote many
of his books at the Oriental...

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,637
...and one of his typewriters remains
in the suite they named for him.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,869
Is that right?

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,149
Make sure I see that.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,396
-T om.
-Mr. President, it is with pleasure...

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,831
...that I present His Excellency T ada
Sumatra of Thailand. And by...

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,510
...request of the secretary of state,
ask that you accept his credentials...

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,076
...from King Bhumibol Adulyadej
as Thailand's ambassador to the US.

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,068
Mr. Sumatra, I accept your
Ietter of credence from King Adulyadej...

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,192
...and by affixing
my signature and seal...

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,230
...do declare you to be an ambassador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,710
May our people know peace
and prosperity.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,478
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,114
We've got gifts,
and we're gonna stand for pictures.

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,830
-Ambassador, right here.
-Madam, congratulations.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,279
He's got about another two minutes,
and then I've gotta pull him.

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,994
Hey, Charlie, is he done?

54
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,998
-Another two minutes.
-I'd Iike him in the Situation Room.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,432
-Should I tell him it's an emergency?
-No emergency, it's just time-sensitive.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,149
What are you Iooking at?

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,669
You're testing that
preposterous contraption again.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,599
It's not a preposterous contraption.
Mind your own business.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,677
In my day we knew how
to protect ourselves.

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,589
In your day you could turn back
the Indians with a Daniel Boone musket.

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,719
-Sarcasm: the grumpy man's wit.
-Sharpen a pencil, would you?

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,832
-What's up?
-They're gonna Iaunch the intercept.

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,032
I'm sure somebody will come along soon
and tell me it didn't work.

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,878
-Why that attitude?
-It won't work.

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,116
-What do I get if it works?
-What do you get?

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,834
Well, I can't make you
Thailand's ambassador to the U.S...

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,278
-...because I just signed that guy's Ietter.
-Come with me to the Situation Room.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,833
You know what? You are
the Charlie Brown of missile defense.

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,679
-The Pentagon is Lucy.
-I'm not familiar with the reference.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,678
-"Peanuts," Charlie Brown.
-I'm just not conversant in them.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,553
-Why?
-I've never read the comics.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,116
-Leo, were you born at the age of 55?
-I know that there's a dog.

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,153
Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football
and Lucy would hold it.

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,476
Except she'd pull it away
at the Iast minute...

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,274
...and Charlie Brown
would fall on his butt.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,118
-That's funny?
-No.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,433
But each time, Lucy would find a way
to convince Charlie Brown...

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,518
...that this time she wouldn't
pull the ball away, but she would.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,075
And once again, Charlie Brown
would fall on his butt.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,315
-That's funny?
-Satirical.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,476
-What's it satirizing?
-The DOD bringing you...

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,148
...to the Situation Room every time
they run a missile test...

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,796
...so you can come tell me how great
it works so I'II put money in the NMD.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,309
-You should put money in the NMD.
-It doe'sn't work.

85
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,839
It will work. One day. Soon.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,555
There are 3-star generals in there.
Call them Lucy and you're on your own.

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,034
Good morning, Mr. President.

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,028
-Where are we?
-The kill vehicle's on a clear trajectory.

89
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,118
-What's its time to the target?
-Fifty seconds.

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,117
-Colonel, walk the president through.
-Y es.

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,959
Approximately three minutes ago
a missile was Iaunched...

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,039
...with a simulated warhead from
the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,669
And it's gonna hit my garage
in New Hampshire when?

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,599
Well, once the missile cleared
cloud cover, it was detected...

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,588
...by the early-warning satellites, which
Iaunched an interceptor, or kill vehicle.

96
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,193
Ten seconds to SRB sep.

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,994
SRB sep is
"Solid Rocket Booster separation. "

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,997
That means the radar on the ground...

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,589
... has gotten a Iock-on signal
from the kill vehicle.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,233
Go SRB sep.

101
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,159
Confirm Solid Rocket
Booster separation.

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,989
Kill vehicle 's away.
Coming over at 0-4-4.

103
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,435
Roger.

104
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,351
-Roger, Control. We got that 4-4-7.
- Thirty seconds to target intercept.

105
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,834
-Go flight.
-What happens now?

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,474
In 20 seconds it collides
with the nuclear warhead.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,635
-Where?
-Outer space.

108
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,637
Seventeen miles above
Earth's atmosphere.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,434
But we don't have anybody
out there right now, do we?

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,070
-Ten seconds to intercept.
-When we stay at the Oriental...

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,236
...we have to see
James Michener's typewriter.

112
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,318
-Intercept in five.
-Here we go.

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,717
Four. Three. Two. One.

114
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,912
-Is that silence usually a good sign?
-No.

115
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,230
Negative intercept.

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,755
-Have we got sensor readings?
-No.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,230
Negative intercept.
KM warhead overshot target.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,471
-It was just enthusiastic.
-By how much?

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,312
-Leo--
-By how much did it miss?

120
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,358
-Colonel?
-1 37.

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,195
-We missed it by 1 37 feet.
-Miles.

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,513
We missed it by 1 37 miles?

123
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,473
When you consider the size
of outer space, that's not so bad.

124
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,391
By the way, the words
you're Iooking for are, "Oh, good grief. "

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,191
For those of you who haven't seen it,
it's a very Iovely ceremony. It's informal.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,868
The ambassadors are Ied
into the Oval Office...

127
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,196
...probably with a few friends
and family.

128
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,472
They chat with the president,
maybe exchange some gifts...

129
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,638
...and they're presented by the
State Department's chief of protocol...

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,513
...who asks the president to accept
the ambassador's credentials...

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,314
...and the president signs a Ietter
to that effect. Y es?

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,476
You have four
new ambassadors this week.

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,716
Is there an order
in which they're seen?

134
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,592
The order they arrived in Washington.

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
Earlier the president saw
Ambassador Sumatra of Thailand...

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,073
...then it'II be Peter Hans
of Sweden...

137
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,352
...followed by Her Excellency
Renee Ernesto of Argentina...

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,879
...Noah Jola of Burkina Faso...

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,315
...and the newly named
British ambassador...

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,114
...will be arriving just as soon
as he's been newly named.

141
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,038
I thought it was--
I forgot his name.

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,195
-Anthony Bratt?
-Y eah.

143
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,597
Anthony Bratt cited family obligations
and withdrew over the weekend.

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,792
-Weren't they gonna replace him with--?
-Sir Christopher Nealing-Roach?

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,719
No, Sir Christopher has been diagnosed
with encephalitis...

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,831
...contracted during
his posting to Kenya.

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,156
-Who's the new British ambassador?
-I don't know.

148
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,396
When the State Department
tells me, I'II know.

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,670
It's pool photographs only
until tomorrow night...

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,348
...when there'II be a reception
for the new ambassadors.

151
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,675
Thanks, C.J.

152
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,751
Want to know
who's been here the Iongest?

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,996
The dean of the diplomatic corps?
Anybody?

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,233
Guys, you know I study
these things just for you.

155
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,149
It's Prince Bandar bin Sultan
of Saudi Arabia.

156
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,995
I could've also told them Burkina Faso
has a population of 1 1 million...

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,078
...and in even years they host
Africa's Iargest crafts market.

158
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,953
-I need a chance to use that knowledge.
-C.J.?

159
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,276
-Do you know the crops of Burkina Faso?
-No.

160
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,517
Millet, sorghum, rice,
peanuts and cotton.

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,996
Mention in your briefing that
we've accepted a Iast-minute invitation...

162
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,397
...for the president to address
the GIobal Defense Council tomorrow.

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,637
-I thought we passed on the GDC.
-We passed on it three months ago...

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,877
...when we thought the president
was gonna be in South America.

165
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,550
But they Iost their keynote speaker.
We're gonna use this to Iaunch C.A.R.E.

166
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,318
That's what I want you to announce.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,475
-C.A.R.E.?
-Yeah.

168
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,352
-Okay.
-CIean Air Rehabilitation Effort.

169
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,393
-You don't know what it is.
-The CIean Air Rehabilitation Effort?

170
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,352
An effort to clean
and rehabilitate air--

171
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,915
-How can--?
-I'm not involved in environmental policy.

172
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,554
Which will come as a relief
to environmentalists.

173
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,116
-I knew the crops of Burkina Faso.
-I'II brief you Iater.

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,276
-Have we heard from Toby?
-No.

175
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,436
-Do we know if he's Ianded?
-No.

176
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,108
-How's everybody doing in here?
-They're doing fine.

177
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,074
Is global warming a real environmental
condition or merely a temporary anomaly?

178
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,474
Is it a global threat...

179
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,958
...or the exaggerated claim of alarmists?
The time for such debate is over.

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,989
As of today, it shall be the position
of the United States government...

181
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,953
...that global warming constitutes
a clear and present danger...

182
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,914
...to the health and future well-being
of this planet and all its inhabitants.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,792
-Did somebody get that?
-Yes.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,638
-I didn't see writing.
-You wrote it.

185
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,673
I just added "The time
for such debate is over. "

186
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,229
-We got it.
-It sets up the reveal.

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,112
22 trillion in benefits versus
half a trillion in compliance costs.

188
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,198
We're making sure that's right?
We're making sure in a few places?

189
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,674
-I want three sources.
-Fine.

190
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,110
-We don't know if Toby's back?
-You'II know soon.

191
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,197
-Sam?
-Is it Toby? Can I have the phone?

192
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,753
He's standing right there.

193
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,948
Thanks.

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,556
Twenty-two thousand fewer
respiratory-related hospital admissions.

195
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,479
I don't wanna use the stats
unless I have three sources.

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,592
-How was the trip?
-It was fine. What's going on?

197
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,268
The president's gonna speak
at the GDC conference.

198
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,040
-What are you talking about?
-He's gonna Iaunch C.A.R.E.

199
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,435
-Since when?
-Their keynote speaker fell through.

200
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,200
-When was this decision made?
-Last night.

201
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,550
-Why wasn't I involved?
-You were in Kansas City.

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,320
I have a telephone.
I have a damn telephone, Sam.

203
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,080
Frankly, I didn't think--
I thought there'd be a consensus.

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,474
Who was at this meeting?

205
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,716
-Where?
-Where the decision was made.

206
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,230
It was me, Carl Taub at the EPA,
Jane Ziskin was there....

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,715
We've been Iooking
for an opportunity to Iaunch--

208
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,069
-Leo wasn't there?
-No.

209
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,477
We've been Iooking for a platform
for this. What's the problem?

210
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,150
There are a number of problems, any one
of which I could have told you about...

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,148
...had you gotten me on the phone.
We already blew off the AFL-CIO.

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,794
We said the president was gonna be
in South America.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,752
He was gonna be. Now he's not.

214
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,396
Instead, he's speaking to Iabor's
good friend, the environmental Iobby.

215
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,637
He's the president of the United States,
he's nobody's understudy.

216
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,671
You got him out there
Iike Joey Bishop.

217
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,316
I gotta say, I hear all that,
but the president was very enthusiastic.

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,035
-Of course he was enthusiastic.
-I wasn't in there twisting his arm.

219
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,674
I told him this opportunity had opened,
that we had notes...

220
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,155
...so I could finish the speech,
he asked questions...

221
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,716
-...we answered them, he said yes.
-AII right. I understand. AII right.

222
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,717
-It's gonna be a good speech.
-Yeah.

223
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,036
-They need you.
-Thanks.

224
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,550
-How was the trip?
-Fine. I need to see Leo.

225
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,878
Yeah.

226
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,395
-It's not gonna be Sir Christopher.
-I heard.

227
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,717
-I said it's not gonna be Sir Christopher.
-And I said I heard.

228
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,110
-I Iike to say Sir Christopher.
- Who Will it be?

229
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm waiting to hear
from the State Department.

230
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,556
-Me too.
-Maybe it'II be Sir Christopher.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,234
-Can I stop talking to you now?
-What are you doing?

232
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,874
I'm standing with my back
straight against the wall.

233
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,629
-Why?
-I was told by doctors it would relax me.

234
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,910
-Josh?
-Gotta go.

235
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,638
-Y eah?
-Are you okay?

236
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,398
Y eah. What?

237
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,911
Is it true that Leo can't stand a guy
named Lord John Marbury?

238
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,633
-Why?
-A reporter asked me.

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,428
-What's a reporter doing talking to you?
-It's a friend.

240
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,830
Leo has nothing but respect
for John Marbury.

241
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,110
-That's what I said.
-Leo thinks he's a Iunatic.

242
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,278
-He's very handsome.
-Maybe, but Leo thinks he's a Iunatic.

243
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,755
Are you threatened by his brilliance?
You seem to be.

244
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,837
-How do you know he's brilliant?
-His picture.

245
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,554
I'm not threatened by his brilliance
nor his good Iooks.

246
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,273
-His charm?
-Not threatened at all.

247
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,469
I'm sorry, I meant Leo.

248
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,070
Neither Leo or I are threatened
by his brains, his Iooks or his charm.

249
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,159
He is, however, a Iunatic Brit. We're
grateful there's an ocean between us.

250
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,316
-There isn't anymore.
-There isn't what?

251
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,750
-An ocean between you.
-PIease don't tell me--

252
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,430
He's the new British ambassador
to the United States.

253
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,032
Yeah.

254
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,119
-Josh?
-Yeah?

255
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,275
He's dreamy.

256
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,199
I'm gonna stand next to the wall
a Iittle while Ionger.

257
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,958
Okay.

258
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,594
Josh?

259
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,314
-What I need people to do is knock.
-I did knock.

260
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,590
-You didn't wait for a response.
-Why would I?

261
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,792
Because I could have been relaxing
by standing behind that door.

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,955
AII right.

263
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,513
-How was the trip?
-It was fine.

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,631
We're pinch-hitting
at the GDC conference.

265
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,274
I didn't think it was
a good idea, and I said so.

266
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,072
-That seems to have helped.
-Look--

267
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,635
We can't be at the beck
and call of the environment.

268
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,114
-We could insult them.
-Yes.

269
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,275
-I'm kidding.
-I'm not.

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,799
-We were invited.
-Don't care.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,035
What do you have?

272
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,119
Environmental terrorists burnt down
a ski resort and the GDC didn't comment.

273
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,390
Why did terrorists
burn down a ski resort?

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,238
-T o save the Iynx.
-The Iinks?

275
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,395
Yeah.

276
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,433
T errorists burned down
a ski resort to save a golf course?

277
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,993
It's an animal.

278
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,430
-Sam's gonna have strong objections.
-Y es, I know.

279
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,790
-You want me to talk to Leo?
-I'II talk to him.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,752
-I want you to talk to C.J.
-About what?

281
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,270
The Will Rogers dinner is gonna ask
Cornelius Sykes to host.

282
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,232
-You're kidding me.
-No.

283
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,398
-He didn't Iaugh at the joke.
-Talk to C.J.

284
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,716
Why do you relax
by standing behind a door?

285
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,151
I'm not. I'm standing
with my back against the wall--

286
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,271
I don't care.

287
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,629
Yeah.

288
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,432
Keith, I--

289
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,954
Keith, I can't tell him that.

290
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,789
I can't tell the president
that nine out of 1 0 things went right.

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,514
He's gonna say,
"Yeah, but we didn't hit anything. "

292
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,119
Would you, please?

293
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,151
Thank you.

294
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,478
We had an NMD test this morning.

295
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,955
We were successful
on nine out of 1 0 criteria.

296
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,629
-We missed?
-Yeah.

297
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,791
-By how much?
-We were trying to shoot down...

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,797
...an intercontinental
ballistic missile.

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,798
Once you miss,
it really doe'sn't matter by how much.

300
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,952
-I suppose.
-1 37 miles.

301
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,555
-Sam just told me about the speech.
-Which speech?

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,830
-The GDC. Leo--?
-I wasn't in the meeting.

303
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,270
-How did--?
-I wasn't in the meeting.

304
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,993
-I'm saying--
-It happened fast.

305
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,509
Sam pitched it
and the president wanted to do it.

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,109
-How could you not be there?
-I'm getting the president...

307
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,357
...to warm up to a missile shield
that's supposed to save humanity...

308
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,711
...and there is a Iimit to the number
of rooms I can be in at once.

309
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,992
-You wanna file a complaint?
-No.

310
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,878
Good.

311
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,709
-Here's what I think.
-Screw the environmental Iobby?

312
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,559
Did I say that?
Did I say screw the environmental Iobby?

313
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,274
-You didn't say anything.
-Before I even open my mouth...

314
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,517
...you decide I'm gonna say
screw the environmental Iobby.

315
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,476
There's an extent to which we've got
to screw the environmental Iobby.

316
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,319
A public demonstration that
the president's not beholden to them...

317
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,475
...isn't a bad idea.

318
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,989
You think he should walk in
and smack them around?

319
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,795
For 30 seconds of a 40-minute address
announcing an initiative they Iove.

320
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,315
How do you think they'II feel
about the 30 seconds?

321
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,112
Not that good, but that's the point.

322
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,710
We don't have to move to our right
if we can spank the people to our Ieft.

323
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,275
Anything in particular
we wanna spank them for?

324
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,914
Failing to publicly admonish
acts of eco-terrorism.

325
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,588
The GDC doe'sn't engage
in acts of eco-terrorism.

326
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,109
But they fail to publicly
admonish those who do.

327
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,630
-For example?
-A Colorado ski development...

328
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,717
...that was under construction
was set on fire...

329
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,514
...because it threatened
the habitat of a rare, Iocal Iynx.

330
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,119
-Is a Iynx a--?
-I don't know.

331
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,675
It's Iike a possum or something.
It doe'sn't matter.

332
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,919
-AII right, tell Sam to out it.
-I don't want it in the advance text.

333
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,636
I don't want Sam and his 1 4 objections.
It should just be a drop-in.

334
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,513
I'II talk to the president.
Anything else?

335
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,315
-1 37 miles?
-Yeah.

336
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,233
-Is that a Iot?
-Yeah.

337
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,358
Okay.

338
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,874
We have 30 minutes at the ballroom
after the speech to spin...

339
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,513
...and the next morning as well.

340
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,029
Among the things you wanna be
emphasizing are what?

341
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,310
America's the biggest emitter
of carbon dioxide.

342
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,953
We have 4% of the population.

343
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,993
We're responsible for 25%
of the greenhouse emissions.

344
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,270
How are we gonna reduce
those Ievels, you ask?

345
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,391
-The CIean Air Rehabilitation Effort.
-Yes.

346
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,272
Which you can read about on page 1 1.

347
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,040
Don't skip the footnotes
and just read what's underlined.

348
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,834
Were you able to get girls to go out
with you in school?

349
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,439
-Yes.
-Really?

350
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,632
These regulations would cap
the volume of carbon dioxide...

351
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,956
...a company could emit in a year.
What's the good news?

352
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,230
If the company comes
in Iower than the cap...

353
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,159
...they can sell the balance
of their emissions allowance.

354
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,873
-Creating what?
-A cash incentive.

355
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,674
Can you tell us anything else
about that, C.J.?

356
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,798
No, but I can tell you that
Iumber, cocoa beans...

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,639
...aluminum and petroleum are
the major exports of Cameroon.

358
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,909
Then you're all set.

359
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,111
-Can I have her for a second?
-Y eah.

360
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,436
-Why do you ask him?
-He Iooked in charge.

361
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,198
-Of where I go?
-Can we please?

362
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,430
Did you hear they named John Marbury
British ambassador? Lord John Marbury?

363
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,438
I know. It's gotta be Iike Davy Jones
himself was showing up.

364
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,076
Don't make fun of Davy Jones, all right?
He once wrote me a Ietter.

365
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,714
He took that kind of time.
And he still tours.

366
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,151
PIus, my Iove for John Marbury is real.
It's not a schoolgirl crush.

367
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,430
-He calls me principessa.
-Doe's he?

368
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,153
-Yes.
-Well, he calls Leo "Gerald. "

369
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,271
He's eccentric.
What do you need?

370
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,075
Janice Barry says Cornelius Sykes will
be asked to host the Will Rogers dinner.

371
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,759
-For sure?
-They' re gonna ask him.

372
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,632
They' re trying to stir this up again?

373
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,276
He didn't Iaugh at the joke. How many
more ways are there to say that?

374
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,471
-You guys are friends--
-We're not friends.

375
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,716
-You know each other.
-We don't hang out.

376
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,353
Yeah, but you know him.

377
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,437
-Where is he?
-In New York doing stand-up.

378
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,312
-Since you'II be there--
-I'II see him.

379
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,397
-Thank you.
-He didn't Iaugh at the joke.

380
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,953
You'II see him tomorrow night?

381
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,639
-Josh.
-Arrange a meeting...

382
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,037
...tomorrow in New York with C.J.
and Cornelius Sykes and no one else.

383
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,515
-Yeah.
-Thank you!

384
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,359
And I was thinking,
when Marbury gets here...

385
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,030
...you could encourage him to introduce
me to any royal, single men he knows.

386
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,992
That's a good idea. I'II do that.

387
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,270
-You're not really, though. Are you?
-No.

388
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,677
I think many people don't realize
that Swedes have Iived in Sweden...

389
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,111
...more than 5000 years Ionger
than nearly any other European people.

390
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,275
That's right, sir.

391
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,914
In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden
played a role...

392
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,759
...in the disintegration
of the Roman Empire, did they not?

393
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,916
-They did.
-So you've got that to answer for.

394
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,155
-Yes, sir.
-Tom.

395
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,876
Mr. President, with pleasure I present
His Excellency Peter Hans of Sweden...

396
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,877
...and by request
of the secretary of state...

397
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,469
...ask you to accept his credentials
from King Carl Gustaf...

398
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,636
...as Sweden's ambassador
to the United States.

399
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,150
Mr. Hans, I accept your Ietter
of credence from King Gustaf...

400
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,194
...and by affixing my signature and seal
do hereby declare you to be...

401
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,278
...an ambassador extraordinary
and plenipotentiary.

402
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,119
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Congratulations.

403
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,118
Mr. Ambassador, right this way.
Family, please.

404
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,509
-Congratulations, ambassador.
-Leo.

405
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,315
Is he still holding you responsible
for the fall of the Roman Empire?

406
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,839
-Yes.
-Welcome to my world.

407
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,792
-I'II see you at the reception?
-Yes.

408
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,955
Congratulations.

409
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,436
Mr. Ambassador, you and your family
can step this way.

410
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,269
Sweden has a 100-percent
Iiteracy rate. A hundred percent.

411
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,552
-How do they do that?
-Maybe they don't and they can't count.

412
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,715
Maybe.

413
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,797
-I really think you should know--
-Y es?

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,389
Nine out of the 1 0 criteria
that the DOD Iays down...

415
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,397
...for success
in these tests were met.

416
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,953
-The tenth being?
-We missed.

417
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,912
-Damn! So close.
-Mr. President--

418
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,879
It's that tenth one.
See, if there were just nine--

419
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,719
Look, the tracking software
on the KM vehicle...

420
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,276
...clearly acquired a read
on both the target and the decoy.

421
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,189
And for the first time ever, successfully
rendered a clean identification.

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,994
Seriously, when they were
telling you that on the phone...

423
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,191
...how stupid did you think
you'd sound saying it?

424
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,038
-This project needs money.
-It doe'sn't work.

425
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,676
Neither did phases of Apollo 1 1, but
Neil Armstrong claims it was a success.

426
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,633
-Do we need to decide this right now?
-No.

427
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,992
So about the GDC speech. Since we're
giving them exactly what they want...

428
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,317
...Toby thinks it's not a bad idea
to signal our independence as well.

429
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,033
-How?
-A drop-in.

430
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,708
Eco-terrorism that's gone
unadmonished by the GDC.

431
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,071
-For example?
-A ski development in Colorado...

432
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,077
...that threatened a rare Iynx
was burned.

433
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,989
And we can't take it for granted that
everyone pretty much opposes arson?

434
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,795
A year and a half ago,
you took AI Caldwell's head off...

435
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,754
...because the Christian League hadn't
publicly admonished religious extremists.

436
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,793
It'd be hypocrisy not to hold friends
to the same standard.

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,310
Y et it feels strange scoring political
points by doing the right thing.

438
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,511
I'm victim to my own
purity of character.

439
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,712
Whatever. We'II get you
some information on the Iynx...

440
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,672
...which is a kind of possum, I think.

441
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,872
It's not a kind of a possum,
so you get me that information.

442
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,799
-Toby doe'sn't want it in the speech?
-Just a drop-in.

443
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,592
-Did you hear?
-About Marbury?

444
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,994
-Isn't it great?
-Yes, sir.

445
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,953
-I assume you're enjoying my suffering.
-Absolutely.

446
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,149
-Anything else?
-No.

447
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,475
Thank you, Mr. President.

448
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,513
Two thousand environmentalists
are gonna try to kill me.

449
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,314
-We should go, sir.
-They'II come at me with vegan food.

450
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,238
Doe'sn't sound
Iike something people do.

451
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,069
Still, I'd Iike you to get between me
and any boiled seaweed you see coming.

452
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,235
Mr. President?

453
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,510
-Leo just talked to me.
-About the GDC tonight--

454
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,235
I'm not doing this for politics
but because it's the right thing to do.

455
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,396
Well, I'm doing it for the politics.

456
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,592
-A Iynx isn't a possum.
-I think it's in the possum family.

457
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,075
-It's a cat.
-And we don't have enough of those.

458
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,191
How doe's Sam feel about this?

459
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,355
Toby?

460
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,155
This isn't Government Camp. It's not
important that everybody gets to play.

461
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,351
I won't tell you how
to run your office.

462
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,516
Thank you, sir.

463
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,953
Vegan food
coming at me all night Iong.

464
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,151
-C.J.?
-Yeah.

465
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,032
-Where you going?
-New York, New York.

466
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,117
-The town so nice they named it twice.
-Why?

467
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,073
I'm receiving an award from
New York Women in Communications.

468
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,235
For what?

469
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,158
I discovered a comet.
What do you mean?

470
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,830
Past winners include Cokie Roberts,
Diane Sawyer and Ms. Leslie Stahl.

471
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,349
-Josh talk to you about--?
-I'm meeting him after.

472
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,472
And you're briefed
on the CIean Air Rehabilitation?

473
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,196
You'II need this: "The president's always
spoken out against moderate groups...

474
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,595
...not taking responsibility
for extremism...

475
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,030
...and he won't stop
with the environmental Iobby.

476
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,832
Friends are honest with each other. "

477
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,553
-He's gonna do a drop-in?
-Yeah.

478
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,876
I'II see you tomorrow night.

479
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,119
Hey, Toby, you wanna see the speech?
Sam's writing a good one.

480
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,558
Yeah.

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,672
Climate changes have accelerated...

482
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,678
...glaciers are shrinking,
the polar sea ice is what?

483
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,075
-It's thinning.
-The polar sea ice is thinning...

484
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,510
...causing a rise in sea Ievels
around the globe.

485
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,314
What do we say when they say
the proposals in C.A.R.E...

486
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,592
...would seriously choke the auto,
trucking and utility business?

487
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,112
Twenty-two trillion dollars in benefits
versus half a trillion in compliance costs.

488
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,390
-Public health benefits.
-We'II make it clear.

489
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,635
-Where's C.J.?
-New York.

490
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,673
-What's she doing in New York?
-She had a Iunch. Media Women?

491
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,393
-That was today.
-She had to stay.

492
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,273
-So it's just me?
-Yeah. Call me from the place.

493
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,674
Yeah.

494
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,716
-Final draft?
-Well, it's the 1 2th draft.

495
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,388
Whether it's a final draft is
really up to you.

496
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,556
-Was that sass?
-Yeah.

497
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,828
Okay. The difference between
a good speech and a great speech...

498
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,316
...is the energy with which the audience
comes to their feet at the end.

499
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,794
Is it polite? Is it a chore?

500
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,798
Are they standing up
because their boss just stood up?

501
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,117
No, you want it to come
from their socks. We got half an hour.

502
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
Let's read this again.

503
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,150
Every time one of these tests fails...

504
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,511
...congressional Democrats jump on it
as a reason to kill the program.

505
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,075
You're not gonna turn
the president around on this.

506
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,636
I'm not gonna turn him around today
and probably not tomorrow...

507
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,637
...but as Iong as somebody
has the money...

508
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,434
...to keep trying to make it work,
then I'm fine.

509
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,830
-There's someone here to see you.
-Who?

510
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,715
-Gerald!
-Oh, God.

511
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,391
-Gerald, old friend.
-Good to see you, ambassador.

512
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,349
It's as if the gods themselves insist
that we be not Iong apart, you and I.

513
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,994
They do seem to strongly
insist upon that, yes.

514
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,555
Your assistant Margaret is
Iooking positively buxom.

515
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,637
-Thank you, I'II tell her.
-Thank you.

516
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,432
Yes, well done.

517
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,870
-John?
-My aide, Caprice.

518
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,672
-How do you do?
-Leo McGarry.

519
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,553
-Good to see you, ambassador.
-God bless you, Josh.

520
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,591
The prayers of millions were answered.

521
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,519
-Thank you, sir.
-I have come.

522
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,712
-Y es.
-I am Lord John Marbury with my aide.

523
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,718
I am hereby presenting my credentials
in the fervent hope--

524
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,115
-We do that Iater with the president.
-Excellent.

525
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,914
I will tell you, though,
that I personally welcome you...

526
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,111
...and I Iook forward
to our new partnership.

527
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,834
-As do I.
-I know we've had our differences...

528
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,634
...but I think you know I respect you.

529
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,149
I congratulate you
on this auspicious occasion.

530
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,591
-In fact, your arrival couldn't be better.
-How so?

531
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,234
Leo wants the president
to give the NMD more time.

532
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,829
You're an expert.
I hope I can count on your support.

533
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,031
-Well, you'II not have it.
-Why not?

534
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,595
The NMD is an absurdly wasteful
military boondoggle...

535
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,597
...that'II never produce
a working missile.

536
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,360
It violates any number of elements
of the ABM treaty...

537
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,439
...and any argument you make
in its defense will surely be moronic.

538
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,993
-Détente.
-I'm sorry, Gerald.

539
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,713
-We'II have this out.
-Excellent.

540
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,196
Let's go get you knighted
or whatever the hell it is we do.

541
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,874
-Hey.
-Hey, how you doing?

542
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,832
-Not bad.
-Thanks for taking the time.

543
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,715
-Yeah, I gotta get back pretty soon.
-I won't take Iong.

544
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,233
-You wanna stay for the show?
-I gotta get the 7:00 shuttle.

545
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,908
-You want something to drink?
-CIub soda.

546
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,917
AIicia, can I get some club soda?

547
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,714
-I haven't seen the movie.
-You should see it. It's good.

548
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,754
-That's what everyone's saying.
-Well, I appreciate that.

549
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,079
So you know this is
about the Will Rogers dinner.

550
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,269
Yeah.

551
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,072
They're gonna ask you to host...

552
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,750
...and, obviously,
the president's gonna be there.

553
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,513
-We appreciate the support--
-You want me to say no.

554
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,234
We think the press will go back
two years and bring up--

555
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,714
-Let them.
-I don't want to.

556
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,879
Now, you know how I feel about you.
You know I don't mean you disrespect--

557
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,594
-You don't?
-No.

558
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,078
I've raised money for you,
I've registered voters for you...

559
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,272
...I've done commercials for you
and I've voted for you.

560
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,948
Because of something
I never did wrong two years ago...

561
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,037
...you don't wanna be
on the dais with me.

562
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,279
It takes a special kind of arrogance
not to think that that's disrespectful.

563
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,555
Thanks, AIicia.

564
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,836
Make your case.
I gotta be funny in a while.

565
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,911
-It missed by 1 37 miles.
-Yes.

566
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,317
If it missed by 37 fewer miles,
it would have still missed by 100 miles.

567
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,114
-It doe'sn't work.
-That depends what your definition is.

568
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,153
My definition is precisely the same
as everyone else's.

569
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,271
-John.
-Mr. President.

570
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,675
-It's good to have you.
-Your servant, as always.

571
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,031
-What made you agree to the post?
-I suppose it's possible I was drunk.

572
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,429
A reasonable bet.

573
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,039
I've gotta go across town...

574
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,232
...and give an address on global warming
and our planet's future.

575
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,238
-You're not interested, right?
-Good God, no.

576
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,715
Stay here and fight with Leo
about something.

577
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,469
I'II be back in an hour. We'II do
your thing and then enjoy the reception.

578
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,148
-Excellent.
-Indeed.

579
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,512
-An hour, did he say?
-Yes.

580
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,233
I'II need some amusement.

581
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,192
-Good evening, Your Lordship.
-Excellent.

582
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,439
-Corey.
-Hang on. Let me finish.

583
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,153
-It was not a benign joke.
-C.J.--

584
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,839
You don't tell benign jokes.

585
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,508
It was a joke about New York cops
shooting black men.

586
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,473
I'm a black man.
I'm in a room full of rich Democrats.

587
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,910
You thought I was gonna talk
about airline food?

588
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,271
It was a political fundraiser
in the heat of a national campaign.

589
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,630
You weren't doing a set
at Catch a Rising Star.

590
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,592
It's been years since I worked there.

591
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,473
You made the joke.
As inoffensive as you think it was...

592
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,434
...there was enormous pressure on him
to disavow your remarks, and he did not.

593
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,915
And I'm supposed to feel good
about that?

594
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,714
That he didn't disavow me?
That I wasn't disavowed?

595
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,388
We were courting Iaw enforcement.
Don't be naive.

596
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,639
You were also courting the black vote.
I'm not naive.

597
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,593
What did you expect us to do?

598
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,953
I expected that when I was called
in any number of places...

599
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,550
...a Hollywood sleaze, that you might
have said a few words on my behalf.

600
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,354
I expected you were gonna say,
"We in the Bartlet campaign...

601
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,949
...don't believe Cornelius Sykes
is a Hollywood sleaze.

602
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,436
We believe he's a world-class humorist
and millions of Americans agree.

603
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,915
We believe his humor can be
disconcerting to some...

604
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,192
...but those who are making noise now
are feigning their concern...

605
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,278
...in an effort
to frighten white men. "

606
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,792
But what you said was,
"He didn't Iaugh at the joke. "

607
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,711
-Corey--
-He did Iaugh at the joke.

608
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,513
-Yeah.
-He Iaughed at the joke, C.J.

609
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,429
I've been doing this 20 years.
You don't think I'd know if I had him?

610
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,039
I killed that night.

611
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,998
And that was a very big deal for me...

612
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,279
...to play in front of that audience,
to get that man to Iaugh.

613
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,314
And the next day, my parents
read in the paper...

614
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,274
...that I am Hollywood sleaze.

615
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,675
But that's okay, because the candidate
didn't think I was funny.

616
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,750
I understand.

617
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,910
I don't wanna cause any trouble
for the president.

618
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,113
You knew that when you walked in here.

619
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,875
I'II pass on the dinner.

620
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,314
I'II tell them...

621
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,910
...it's because I couldn't
get out of a booking.

622
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,593
But the president Iaughed
at the joke, C.J.

623
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,518
I killed that night.

624
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,275
You did.

625
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,198
Okay. I gotta go.

626
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,430
I'II see you next time.

627
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,471
-Is the president off-stage?
-Just about.

628
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,116
-Anyone know how it's going?
-Toby? It's Sam.

629
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,874
-He admonished them.
-Sam--

630
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,674
He went off the speech at the end
and slapped them down...

631
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,156
...for not speaking out on eco-terrorism.
He just flew off the speech--

632
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,351
-Listen--
-Something about a ski resort--

633
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,959
-Are you Iistening?
-T alk to me.

634
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,276
Say, " Friends are honest
with each other.

635
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,029
The president's spoken out on moderate
groups not taking responsibility...

636
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,470
...and he won't stop
with the environmental Iobby. "

637
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,951
-Okay.
-You got that?

638
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,790
What's happening?

639
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,752
Sam, what's happening?

640
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,474
They' re not standing.

641
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,916
-So you' re actual royalty?
-Y es.

642
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,633
It's not just an honorary thing?

643
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,638
No. In fact, there's Iittle honor
attached to it at all.

644
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,875
T ell me about yourself.

645
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,755
My mother was a descendant of the third
of the nine children of Queen Victoria.

646
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,030
Victoria was the granddaughter
of George III...

647
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,117
...who was the great-grandson
of George I.

648
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,756
George I was the great-nephew
of Charles I...

649
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,712
...who was the son of James I.

650
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,708
And James' mother
was Mary Queen of Scots.

651
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,754
-And are you and Caprice an item?
-No.

652
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,279
-Mr. Ambassador?
-Is he back?

653
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,711
He's back. He's receiving Her Excellency
Renee Ernesto of Argentina...

654
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,115
-...and asks for your patience.
-He shall have it.

655
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,919
-C.J.
-Yeah.

656
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,269
-You just get back?
-Yeah.

657
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,755
-You heard what happened?
-Yeah. Here's what it is:

658
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,871
"The president's spoken out
on moderate groups...

659
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,832
...not taking responsibility
for extremism.

660
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,871
He won't stop
with the environmental Iobby.

661
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,877
Friends are honest with each other. "

662
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,593
Sam?

663
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,552
-Have you spoken to Toby?
-When?

664
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,637
-Since after the speech tonight?
-No.

665
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,154
-Okay.
-They're setting up for the reception?

666
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,679
Yeah.

667
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,428
Sixty billion dollars can be spent
on other things.

668
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,916
I'm all for retention pay,
health benefits, procurement.

669
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,078
I'm talking about Abrams tanks
and Apache helicopters, which work.

670
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,831
An Apache helicopter will not stop
the Shahab-3 Iong-range Stiletto...

671
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,792
...or a North Korean ICBM.

672
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,117
Well, so far, neither can anything else.
Hey, Sam?

673
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,550
I'm going back in there.

674
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,790
-Have you been getting questions?
-I'm sorry?

675
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,275
-Have you been getting questions?
-Yeah.

676
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,358
-From the press, or...?
-The press will be tomorrow.

677
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,471
-Who's asking--?
-The chairman of the GDC...

678
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,712
...four congressmen, the secretary
of the interior, who'd you think?

679
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,310
-What'd you--?
-I said, "Friends have to be honest. "

680
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,274
I said exactly what you told me to say,
which is what C.J. told me to say...

681
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,359
...which is funny considering C.J. was
in New York and didn't speak to you.

682
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,120
It's Iike there were people
who knew it was gonna happen.

683
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,754
-Sam--
-Get away from me.

684
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,270
-Hey, Sam.
-Can I get in for just a minute?

685
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,354
He's pretty tight right now.
I don't think I can get you in.

686
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,356
Well, yes, certainly.
There's Edward, Earl of UIster.

687
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,596
He's the son of Richard,
Duke of GIoucester...

688
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,916
...who's the son of Henry,
Duke of GIoucester.

689
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,997
-Edward, Earl of UIster?
-Yes.

690
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,475
-You think he'd Iike me?
-Do you date younger men?

691
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,193
-Sure, how old is he?
-Five.

692
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,392
Well, Iet's stick a pin in that
for a moment and move on.

693
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,635
-Hello.
-Hello.

694
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,558
-Am I interrupting?
-Not at all.

695
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,673
Ambassador Marbury was just telling me
how royal men are schooled in courtship.

696
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,516
King George III sailed his bride up
the Thames to music specially composed.

697
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,038
That was years before we opened a can
of whup-ass on them at Y orktown.

698
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,713
How can you Iook at North Korea,
which 24 months ago...

699
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,076
-...fired a T aepodong missile--?
-Which failed.

700
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,999
And with some modifications,
it'II be able to reach AIaska.

701
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,239
I don't Iive in AIaska. I Iive in England,
which is not protected by the shield.

702
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,670
Not that anybody else is
at the moment, either.

703
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,599
You forgot that we're both signatories
to the '72 ABM Treaty...

704
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,597
...of which this shield is
in violation.

705
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,872
You forgot it'II compel China
to strengthen their nuclear arsenal.

706
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,436
You forgot European allies have
strong reservations about the shield.

707
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,358
And you forgot that it doe'sn't work.

708
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,397
-You know what I didn't forget?
-What?

709
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,030
That we opened up a big can
of whup-ass on you at Y orktown.

710
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,992
-AII right.
-Leo.

711
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,397
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

712
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,115
I'm gonna correspond with the Earl
of UIster once he Iearns how to read.

713
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,197
Okay.

714
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,840
Here you go.

715
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,190
-No. No, AIice, I got it.
-It's all right.

716
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,955
-No, I got it.
-You want a beer?

717
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,390
Yeah, thanks.

718
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,870
You don't ever go
into the Oval Office mad.

719
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,559
No. No. No.

720
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,676
No, Sam, you don't ever go
in there mad.

721
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,558
I think the president's remarks
were ill-advised, to say the Ieast.

722
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,795
You're wrong.

723
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,355
The drop-in's the story now,
not the energy package.

724
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,994
It doe'sn't need to be a story,
it's gonna be a Iaw.

725
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,077
We don't need the environmental Iobby?

726
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,398
-I don't think we're gonna Iose them.
-I think you're tragically misguided.

727
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,512
Most environmentalists are absolutists
who will use this insult...

728
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,473
...to pull their support undercover
we cut a deal with Detroit.

729
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,638
Well, then they can grow up, Sam.
"Use this insult"?

730
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,838
They got their energy package
and the president at their dinner.

731
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,995
They should shut up!

732
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,078
Well, you should explain it
to them just that way, Toby...

733
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,078
...because they're really
pretty receptive to that argument.

734
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,192
When they see the alternatives
on the ballot, they get receptive fast.

735
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,871
Was there anything else,
or can I sit here now?

736
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,755
-You can sit here. See you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

737
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,474
I see opposition polling
that scares the hell out of me.

738
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,114
I see internal numbers
that change by the hour.

739
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,598
-I Iisten to economists that tell me--
-You Ieft me out.

740
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,350
You think I made you Iose
on the Ieadership breakfast?

741
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,754
-I got creamed.
-Because of me?

742
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,430
-I didn't want the discussion!
-Then why are you here talking to me?

743
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,710
Now you want the discussion.

744
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,552
You may think they deserved it...

745
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,038
...but the cynicism of attacking friends
for political protection offends them.

746
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,310
And it offends me.

747
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,150
It offends you, and there's nothing I can
do to make you feel better about that.

748
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,758
We can't govern if we don't win.

749
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,910
You should've talked to me
about the numbers more.

750
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,712
Yeah.

751
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,990
-Anyway, I have this beer so--
-Yeah.

752
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,909
-I was gonna sit down and drink it.
-Yeah.

753
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,949
-We don't have to talk or anything.
-Yeah.

754
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,593
That was Chairwoman Shelly Loobis
I just got off the phone with.

755
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,439
Before that was a conference call
with Jamie Schwartz...

756
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,189
...of the Environmental Defense Fund,
Bryce Davis from the Sierra CIub...

757
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,279
...and people from the Sub-Committee
on Energy and Environment.

758
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,358
The number of different words
they had for "manipulative"...

759
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,472
...there's no way they didn't have
a thesaurus with them.

760
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,595
Bryce Davis said if I keep this up,
he's gonna encourage Seth Gillette...

761
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,711
-...in a third-party bid.
-What'd you say?

762
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,708
I said for $50 and a ride to the airport,
Gillette could have the job right now.

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,071
-What'd you say?
-I reminded them it isn't a good idea...

764
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,077
...to threaten the president.
Nancy!

765
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,078
I wanna know when you're pushing me
towards the missile shield...

766
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,840
...it's not because you want me
to Iook strong on defense.

767
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,877
-Yes, sir?
-Tell Charlie I'm ready.

768
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,837
-I'm pushing you because it works.
-Based on what?

769
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,038
Confidence, and the understanding
that there's been a time...

770
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,391
...in the evolution of everything
that works when it didn't work.

771
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,909
You know, can I say this?
Why don't we just...

772
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,954
...give the $60 billion to North Korea
in exchange for not bombing us?

773
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,516
It's hard to believe that you're not
on the National Security Council.

774
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,631
I feel they're missing
an important voice.

775
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,193
-Mr. President.
-Good evening.

776
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,709
John, Iet me explain
why you've been waiting.

777
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,198
I have to see people in the order they
arrive and you got beat by Argentina.

778
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,437
You Iost out on preferred seating
for the State of the Union.

779
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,232
-I have to attend it?
-Yes.

780
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,510
-Well, then attend it I shall.
-Okay. T om.

781
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,157
It is with pleasure that I present
Lord John Marbury of Great Britain.

782
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,989
And by request of the secretary of state,
ask you to accept his credentials...

783
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,316
...from Her Royal Majesty
Queen EIizabeth II...

784
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,433
...as Great Britain's ambassador
to the United States.

785
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,075
Where are you on the missile shield?

786
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,919
Well, I think it's dangerous, illegal...

787
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,588
...fiscally irresponsible,
technologically unsound...

788
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,519
...and a threat
to all people everywhere.

789
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,313
I think the world invented
a nuclear weapon.

790
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,429
I think the world should see if it can't
invent something to make it irrelevant.

791
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,200
Well, that's the right sentiment.

792
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,756
And certainly a credible one
from a man who's fought in a war.

793
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,474
You think you can make it stop?

794
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,511
Well, you can't.

795
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,549
We build a shield, and somebody
will build a better missile.

796
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,878
Well, it's a discussion
for serious men.

797
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,755
They say a statesman is a politician
who's been dead for 1 5 years.

798
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,554
I'd Iike us to be statesmen
while we're still alive.

799
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,911
Lord Marbury, I accept your Ietter
of credence from Queen EIizabeth...

800
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,997
...and by affixing
my signature and seal...

801
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,035
...declare you to be an ambassador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary.

802
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,670
Thank you, sir.

803
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,439
Congratulations.

804
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,034
-God bless America.
-God save the queen.

805
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,556
Let's go.

806
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,035
