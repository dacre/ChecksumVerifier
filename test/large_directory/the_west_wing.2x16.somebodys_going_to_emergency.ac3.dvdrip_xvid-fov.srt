Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,110
When did you decide you'd run
for a second term?

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,874
-I didn't make the decision to run again.
-We had a deal.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,192
Andrew Jackson had
a big block of cheese.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,556
It's Throw Open Our Office
Doors to People...

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,389
...Who Want to Discuss Things That
We Could Care Less About Day.

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,718
Sam?

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,754
-What day is this?
-It's Friday.

9
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,758
I'm sorry, I meant-- I'm sorry.
What time is it?

10
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,993
-You sleep here Iast night?
-I'm sorry?

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,636
-You slept here?
-I don't have a couch in my office.

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,956
Y eah, but you have a bed
in your house, right?

13
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,596
-I need to change my shirt.
-Maybe you need to go home for a while.

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,110
-What are you doing here so early?
-T rying to avoid the protesters.

15
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,357
Metro police closed a four-block
radius around the World Bank...

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,109
...and made Pennsylvania Avenue
one-way from M to 21 st.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,876
1 7th and 1 5th are closed
to Independence Avenue...

18
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,878
...and Constitution's closed
between 23rd and the EIIipse.

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,038
-Did you take Dupont?
-Dupont had two turns closed off...

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,549
...with metal barricades
and cop cars.

21
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,311
So I took P to Logan Circle,
which was also blocked.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,195
So I made a U-turn and
doubled back to get on 1 6th...

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,393
...where there was a police cordon
around the National Geographic Society.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,239
Who has a problem with
the National Geographic Society?

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,036
-That's exactly what I want to know.
-Anyway, I'm gonna change my shirt.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,714
What's going on with
the pardon recommendations?

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,276
They' re coming together. I've reviewed
recommendations from Justice...

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,630
...and the OPA, and T ribbey's
office had its own.

29
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,713
-How many are you sending in?
-Eighteen, I think, now.

30
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,317
Mail fraud, securities fraud and the
most bogus drug bust I've ever seen.

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,596
-Don't retry the cases.
-I'm not retrying.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,355
I'm reading material I'm supposed to
read, I'm making the recommendations.

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,233
The guy was tried in Spain
and found guilty of a crime...

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,512
-... he was too stupid to commit.
-Sam, go home, would you?

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,435
-No. I'm just gonna change my shirt.
-You Iook bad. You're tired.

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,950
-You slept in the office, it's Friday, go.
-Why?

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,311
Because you' re putting too much
faith in the powers of a new shirt.

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,031
Josh told me what happened,
with your parents.

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,430
-Sam?
-Y eah.

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,154
-My father had affairs.
-Did he?

41
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,713
Y eah.

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,710
My father didn't pick up a waitress.
He's had a woman in an apartment.

43
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,956
-Yeah?
-For 28 years.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,430
How'd he get caught?

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,029
My father is stupider
than the guy in Spain.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,630
So the real question is, how did
he not get caught until now?

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,719
-Yeah.
-I'II see you at the staff meeting Iater.

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,108
-Sam.
-Y eah.

49
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,635
-When did you find out?
-T uesday.

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,035
-You slept here the Iast three nights?
-No.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,357
-Seriously, man, go home.
-I'm gonna check the final OPA Iist.

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,597
I'II be checking it twice. See who's
been naughty, who's been nice.

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,995
-Sam.
-Life goes on, Leo.

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,237
Certainly the federal government
doe's. So....

55
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,750
-Thanks, but Iet's drop it, okay?
-Y eah.

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,758
They' re expecting trouble
at the National Geographic Society?

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,313
I have no explanation.

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,830
Well, those postcards they stick in
magazines drive me out of my mind.

59
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,678
-So maybe...?
-Y eah.

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,518
I'II see you Iater.

61
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,278
Hey, Sam. This is Ginger. It's 6:35.
I've opened the communications office.

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,318
-It's a good speech.
-The Andrew Jackson speech.

63
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,909
-It is a good speech.
-Better every year, but--

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,031
-What?
-You're not gonna give it, right?

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,719
-Sure.
-Why?

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,070
Because it's Big BIock
of Cheese Day, Josh.

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,033
Y eah, see, but we know it's
Big BIock of Cheese Day...

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,472
...and we know why it's called that,
so there's no need for the speech.

69
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,797
Except it wouldn't be Big BIock
of Cheese Day without the speech.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,752
Well, Iet's find out. Maybe it would.

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,394
-How'd you get to work this morning?
-I walked.

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,192
-Y eah.
-How is it out there?

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,628
It's pretty Ioud.

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,549
World Policy Studies is holding a forum
this morning, I'm gonna send Toby.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,113
-That's a good idea.
-Why?

76
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,038
-Because you' re not sending me.
-Look--

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,755
Leo, the World Bank and the WT O
are international organizations...

78
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,714
...of which the U S. is one member.
Why isn't Switzerland the one--?

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,669
They' re not protesting in Switzerland,
they' re protesting on 1 8th Street.

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,316
And I don't want to be asked
how come no one ever met with them.

81
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,794
Well, that seems reasonable.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
I can't tell you how relieved
I am to have your approval.

83
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,591
-But you' re gonna do the speech.
-Got to.

84
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,030
-Y eah.
-A Iittle thing called team morale.

85
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,312
You gotta make people
feel good about themselves.

86
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,755
AII right. Shut up, everybody, I've fired
more people than you before breakfast.

87
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,114
Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer
of the White House...

88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,916
... had a big block of cheese.
The block of cheese was huge--

89
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,635
-Who made these assignments?
-This'II go faster if I'm not interrupted.

90
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,156
I'm meeting with the Organization
of Cartographers for Social Equality?

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,555
What do mapmakers have
to do with social equality?

92
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,634
-I guess you' re about to find out.
-Probably not, because I won't Iisten.

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,189
-The block of cheese was huge--
-Excuse me, Leo.

94
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,631
I got NIH research funding for cancer
treatment using shark cartilage.

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,438
-I'II take that.
-What do you got?

96
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,955
-Citizens for D. C. Statehood.
-Forget it.

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,594
I've got Kemp's Ridley Sea T urtle
Society, but I'm keeping it.

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,358
You're all keeping it.

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,233
I'm sure Margaret worked
Iong and hard to make sure...

100
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,513
...that the appropriate petitioner
went to the appropriate staffer.

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,395
The block of cheese was two tons...

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,637
...and was there for any and all
who might be hungry.

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,718
-Excuse me, I was waylaid.
-By what?

104
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,831
-Thirty thousand tourists.
-The protesters.

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,952
I don't call them protesters. I've seen
better organized crowds at the DMV.

106
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,953
-Two tons, this cheese--
-In my day, we knew how to protest.

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,952
-What day was that?
-1 968.

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,191
How old were you
when you were protesting?

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,556
My sisters took me.

110
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,637
-Anybody have a problem with that?
-No one has a problem with that.

111
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,435
The police are ahead of them. They know
where they'II be and what'II happen.

112
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,632
Know how? By Iogging on to their
website. We had the underground.

113
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,116
-We had rapid response.
-And you were home by supper.

114
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,316
These are amateurs.
What's my assignment?

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,835
Meeting with the amateurs.

116
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,277
World Policy Studies is having a forum,
there'II be about 100 of them.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,039
-Doing what?
-Listening to you...

118
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,356
...conduct a free exchange of ideas.

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,154
-Really?
-Josh thinks it's a good idea.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,233
Well, if Josh thinks it's a good idea,
then you bet, I'II do it.

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,716
-What else is there?
-Cartographers for Social Equality.

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,436
You have two choices. Meeting an unruly
mob or meeting with Iunatic mapmakers.

123
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,433
Or getting paid a Iot more
working almost anywhere else.

124
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,636
Seriously, there'II be security there.

125
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,558
-What about press?
-Just wires.

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,830
-No, I mean TV.
-No cameras.

127
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,678
-You negotiated that?
-Y eah.

128
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,079
-They agreed to it?
-You wanna make out with me now.

129
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,197
Well, when don't I?

130
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,311
-Give me the thing.
-Okay, then.

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,796
Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer
of the White House...

132
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,554
... had a 2-ton block of cheese.

133
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,228
And a Wheat Thin the size
of Lake T ahoe.

134
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,275
It was there for any and all who were
hungry. It was there for the voiceless.

135
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,228
-Stephanie.
-Hi.

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,788
-You Iook great.
-Thank you.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,514
-Why are you talking Iike that?
-I don't want to shout.

138
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,712
-We can use our normal voices.
-I've never been in the White House.

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,593
-Later I'II give you a tour.
-Did I get you out of something?

140
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,109
We're not allowed to give tours
until after 1 0:00...

141
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,676
...when the president's out of
the West Wing. Come with me.

142
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,599
-The president works until 1 0:00?
-He works after that.

143
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,191
But he Ieaves the Oval at 1 0.
We'II go in Josh's office.

144
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,957
I am getting you out
of something, right?

145
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,594
You got me out of
the Big BIock of Cheese Day meeting.

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,792
-What's--?
-I had the feeling you were gonna ask.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,629
Andrew Jackson had, in the main
foyer of the White House...

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,638
... I can't believe I'm giving this speech,
a 2-ton block of cheese.

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,276
In that spirit, Leo McGarry designates
one day for senior staff members...

150
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,313
...to take appointments with people
that wouldn't ordinarily...

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,715
-...get the ear of the White House.
-Sounds amazing.

152
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,236
We make a Iot of fun of it,
but truth is, I think it is.

153
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,474
-I'm sorry to--
-Oh, yeah.

154
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,236
Were you able to mention me
to Sam Seaborn?

155
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,830
-I wasn't. I haven't yet, and I apologize.
-No, that's okay.

156
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,153
-It's been a bad week for Sam.
-From everything I've been told...

157
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,555
...the president Iistens to Sam
when it comes to....

158
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,113
Y eah.

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,909
I should have said this on the phone.

160
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,152
-I'm not that comfortable with--
-That's--

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,920
It puts him in an awkward position
if he has to say no.

162
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,953
And something Iike this,
if it seems Iike a favor....

163
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,708
Steph, is your dad dying?

164
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,269
Okay, Iisten.
When we'rein with Sam...

165
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,951
... mention you've heard he's the man.
He'II want to impress you and show...

166
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,118
-... he's got access to the president.
-Wait a minute.

167
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,917
-You're getting me in? It's all right?
-Yeah. It's Big BIock of Cheese Day.

168
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,314
It's me. I need some time with Sam.

169
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,757
I don't need to see
the 1 0-year numbers.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,513
It'd be a good idea to Iook at them.

171
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,995
Have those projections
ever been close to accurate?

172
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,509
-Depends what you mean.
-Within a trillion dollars.

173
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,517
No, but we'd Iike you
to Iook at them.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,030
Bring me the 1 0-year projections,
a Ouija board and a magic wand.

175
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,753
-Yes, sir. Thank you.
-What's next?

176
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,757
I need to discuss a fax
that's come in.

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,279
-From whom?
-Jonathan Bartlet.

178
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,630
-That name sounds familiar.
-He's your brother.

179
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,831
I remember being Iocked
in a steamer trunk.

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,396
-That doe'sn't sound so bad.
-There were steamers in there with me.

181
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,750
-I was in there with seafood.
-Okay.

182
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,996
-Well, here's the thing--
-We Iost the site?

183
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,191
-You Iost the first choice.
-Why?

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,231
Your brother's speaking
with Neda Wallin...

185
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,908
...counsel to the Bartlet Presidential
Library Commission.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,078
The site violates the Historic Barn
and Bridges Preservation Act.

187
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,790
-Which says?
-I've got it here in my notes.

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,591
Requires that all non-housing farm and
ranch structures built prior to 1 900...

189
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,553
... be preserved unless destroyed
by an act of God.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,151
What plaid-flannel-wearing, cheese-eating
yahoo of a milkman governor...

191
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,352
...signed that idiot bill into state Iaw?

192
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,635
-It was me, wasn't it?
-Y es, sir.

193
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,991
-Okay.
-They'd Iike to go with the second site.

194
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,714
-Y eah. Go ahead.
-Thank you, sir.

195
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,118
-No.
-I'm sorry?

196
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,432
No, don't go ahead with the site.

197
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,872
I just-- T ell my brother to hang on,
would you? I'II make a decision.

198
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,675
-I don't know what the damn hurry is.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,556
Bonnie, I now need
the 1 0-year OMB projections as well.

200
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,398
-Are those ever accurate?
-No.

201
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,512
-And you got another call from--
-Thanks.

202
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,510
-Sam?
-Oh, hey, how you doing?

203
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,792
Sam, this is Stephanie Gault.
Stephanie, this is Sam.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,070
-It's good to meet you.
-Come on in.

205
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,271
Stephanie and I were
at Wisconsin together.

206
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,359
We bonded as a result of a mutual
Ioathing for the same ex-boyfriend.

207
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,950
She's a professor of International
Relations at the Maxwell School.

208
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,639
What are you doing in town?

209
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,594
Believe it or not, I advise the WTO
in certain areas of macroeconomics.

210
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,190
So a global monetary crisis
can't be very far off.

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,234
-What can I do for you?
-My grandfather was Daniel Gault.

212
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,591
-Really?
-Y eah.

213
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,837
-You know who Daniel Gault was?
-He was a staffer here in the '40s.

214
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,640
He was a special economic
assistant to FDR...

215
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,196
...and special Iiaison to State
for Eastern European Affairs.

216
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,398
-Donna knows the rest.
-He was jailed for espionage...

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,876
-...and died in prison six months Iater.
-He wasn't in jail for espionage.

218
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,073
They couldn't make espionage.
He was in jail for Iying in front of HUAC.

219
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,999
Sam, Stephanie would Iike
her grandfather included...

220
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,158
...among those being considered
for an executive pardon.

221
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,955
From everything I've Iearned, you' re
the person to speak to about this.

222
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,357
That you have the ear
of the president.

223
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,159
Yeah.

224
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,429
It's impossible to demonstrate remorse
since he's no Ionger alive.

225
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,200
Demonstrating his innocence
is extremely complicated.

226
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,956
-Y es, but you've already done it.
-Excuse me?

227
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,512
You've already demonstrated his
innocence, and in a compelling way.

228
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,597
You've also spoken on the need
for his pardon.

229
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,997
-When did I do that?
-At Princeton.

230
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,953
For 23 pages in the middle
of your thesis.

231
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,516
-Where did you get that?
-You sent it to my father.

232
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,472
I did.

233
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,270
I know it doe'sn't seem
there should be a rush...

234
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,597
...about getting a pardon for someone
who's been dead 50 years...

235
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,429
-... but time's become a factor.
-Your father's sick?

236
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,238
Y eah.

237
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,831
You guys wanna go to the mess
and get some coffee or something?

238
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,519
Y eah.

239
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,994
-Toby Ziegler.
-Y eah.

240
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,152
Rhonda, this guy coming
in is Toby Ziegler.

241
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,078
Copy that.

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,513
-Mr. Ziegler?
-Y es, ma'am.

243
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,359
They asked me to make sure
you go home in one piece.

244
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,913
-You fully trained?
-Y es.

245
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,998
-How many ways do you know to kill?
-How many ways do I need?

246
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,031
-I Iike you.
-Thank you.

247
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,514
-Officer Sachs?
-Y eah.

248
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,438
It's gonna be a day at the beach.

249
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,357
-You do understand how it works?
-Y eah.

250
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,235
Recommendations come from the OPA,
Office of the Pardon Attorney.

251
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,795
Then the president gets
into it and often...

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,833
...sends it to counsel's
office for further review.

253
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,237
-It can be a drawn-out process.
-Y eah.

254
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,990
What I'm gonna do today is speak to
somebody at the Justice Department.

255
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,553
Which branch of Justice?

256
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,988
-The FBI.
-Sam.

257
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,754
I won't start in on this
without giving them a heads-up.

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,197
My father requested the file
in the Iate ' 70s and was denied.

259
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,038
He sued under
Freedom of Information.

260
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,356
The judge ruled the file
couldn't be disclosed...

261
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,477
... because it met three
of nine exemptions.

262
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,955
National defense and
foreign relations information...

263
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,435
...internal agency rules and practices
and personal privacy.

264
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,871
AII because the FBI is embarrassed
about this period in their history.

265
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,390
I know, and that's why
I have to give them a heads-up.

266
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,878
Doe's Donna know how to get in touch?
I'II tell you how it's going.

267
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,759
-We have your number?
-Y eah.

268
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,916
Actually, we'remeeting
for dinner tonight.

269
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,557
Stephanie, the reason I mentioned
that it could be a drawn-out process....

270
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,036
I understand. I just need to be able
to give him some good news.

271
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,030
He's a sweet man in a bow tie,
Sam. His father....

272
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,476
-He's been trying for so Iong to--
-Y eah. Okay, I'II see you Iater, then.

273
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,472
-Hey, Steph.
-Hey, Josh.

274
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,557
You're across the street
in five minutes.

275
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,638
-I'm walking out with you.
-Sam, thank you.

276
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,359
Yeah.

277
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,958
-You on the Gault thing?
-Yeah.

278
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,789
-That's nice of you. I appreciate that.
-Yeah. I'II give the Bureau a heads-up.

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,037
-They' re not gonna be happy about it.
-No kidding.

280
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,469
Did you know Lincoln signed a pardon
on the day he was assassinated?

281
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,238
-You know the name?
-Patrick Murphy.

282
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,998
-What he was pardoned for?
-Union deserter.

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,428
-Am I annoying you?
-Y eah.

284
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,471
-T rying to make you Iaugh.
-I appreciate it.

285
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,070
-Can I see your friend at the FBI?
-Y eah, can I tell him why?

286
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,633
Y eah.

287
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,800
Hey, you wanna have a Iot
of fun? Seriously?

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,391
C.J. 's meeting with the Organization
of Cartographers for Social Equality.

289
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,636
Where's the social inequality
in cartography?

290
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,398
-That's why I'm going.
-You'II call?

291
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,397
Yeah. That a new shirt?

292
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,477
-Y eah.
-Nice.

293
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,038
-Fire your gun.
-I can't fire a warning shot indoors.

294
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,800
No, I mean fire at them.

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,592
Just kidding.

296
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,355
Hey, Solzhenitsyn. Come here.
Are you the group Ieader?

297
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,039
Y eah. I'm T erry Webber.

298
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,630
You know what you did today that was
stupid? You gave away the cameras.

299
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,478
With cameras here
I've got a problem.

300
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,148
I don't want to Iook Iike
I can't control the crowd.

301
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,636
Without the cameras, I could read
the sports section for two hours...

302
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,552
...walk outside and say we talked.

303
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,991
So if you guys want to talk,
you' re in charge of crowd control.

304
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,919
-You know what I'm saying?
-Y eah.

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,155
Folks! People! Let's Iisten up!

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,718
Good morning.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,199
My name is Toby Ziegler. I'm the White
House communications director...

308
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,118
...and senior domestic
policy advisor.

309
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,278
Advise him we need clean air
more than free trade!

310
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,278
How many 1 2-year-olds
made your shoes, Toby?

311
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,790
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,276
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

313
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,675
-Global justice now!
-Wanna send out for a pizza?

314
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,872
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

315
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,235
-Y es, sir?
-I'm here to see Special Agent Casper.

316
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,591
-My name's Sam Seaborn.
-Seaborn?

317
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,314
-Y eah.
-I ' m sorry, I ' m not seeing your name.

318
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,035
-Agent Casper knows you' re coming?
-Sam.

319
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,430
How you doing, Mike?

320
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,115
Just requesting the file
on Daniel Gault...

321
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,676
...is so wildly outside the parameters
of your authority as an appointee--

322
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,836
Mike, you guys got it wrong
and you know it.

323
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,268
-Really?
-Yes.

324
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,118
What else do I know?

325
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,830
Michael, I gave you the heads-up
as a courtesy.

326
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,917
I don't need permission
to go to the OPA.

327
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,829
-I don't need permission to tell the press.
-He did six months for a capital crime.

328
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,634
-Now you want a pardon?
-Six months for perjury...

329
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,593
-... before dying of a heart attack.
-You know why?

330
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,995
-Prosecutor couldn't make espionage.
-Right.

331
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,714
-Why do you suppose that was?
-I don't suppose, I know.

332
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,514
-Because the U S. attorney blew it.
-1 2 jurors say no, and--

333
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,312
The man was named
by Joe McCarthy--

334
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,556
-The " 20 years of treason"?
-Y es.

335
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,354
Which was called a "conspiracy
on a scale so immense...

336
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,755
...as to dwarf any previous
venture in history. "

337
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,117
Somebody wake me up. You deputized
Joe McCarthy into your argument.

338
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,231
-My point--
-You know who else was on that Iist?

339
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,115
General George Marshall, author of the
Marshall PIan and mentor to Eisenhower.

340
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,754
-After he won WWII.
-We made more than we missed.

341
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,518
Owen Lattimore, I. F. Stone.

342
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,950
Not everybody at State
was wrongly accused.

343
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,029
You rounded up some dangerous TV
comedy writers. Ring Lardner just died.

344
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,674
How many years doe's he get back?

345
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,195
Listen. The Bureau's had moments
in its past that it's not proud of.

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,312
If we comb through the fine print
of history we might find...

347
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,796
...one or two occupants of the
Oval Office who could say the same.

348
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,039
But the difference is, our failures are
public and our successes are private.

349
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,629
When we apprehend
an enemy of the state, Iike, say...

350
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,717
...a member of
West Virginia White Pride...

351
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,593
...we don't take a curtain call
on Sunday with Sam and Cokie.

352
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,190
When it wasn't the Secret Service who
ordered the canopy down in Rosslyn...

353
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,038
...we kept it to ourselves.

354
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,471
PIease, God, Mike, tell me you
weren't just threatening Toby Ziegler.

355
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,392
-I wasn't, Sam.
-Good.

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,953
Y eah.

357
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,753
Anyway, " because the Bureau will be
embarrassed " isn't a good enough reason.

358
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,396
I'm putting Daniel Gault on the Iist.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

359
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,909
-Anything else?
-No.

360
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,911
-Hi, I'm sorry.
-Hello.

361
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,599
-Sorry to be Iate.
-Not a problem.

362
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,279
-I'm C.J. Cregg.
-Of course.

363
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,429
I'm Dr. John Fallow, this is Dr. Cynthia
Sayles and Professor Donald Huke.

364
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,437
-Huke?
-Huke.

365
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,309
Okay. And you are the Organization
of Cartographers for Social Equality.

366
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,551
We're from the OCSE.
We have many members.

367
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,671
-How many?
-4300 dues-paying members.

368
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,918
-What are the dues?
-$20 a year for the newsletter.

369
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
-Let's start.
-Wait, wait, I want to see this.

370
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,076
-This is Josh Lyman.
-Indeed you are.

371
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,111
-Josh, this is Dr. Fallow and...
-Hi.

372
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,675
-... his merry men.
-Y es.

373
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,348
-Should we begin?
-Y es.

374
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,438
PIain and simple, we'd Iike President
Bartlet to strongly support Iegislation...

375
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,269
... making it mandatory for every
public school to teach geography...

376
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,274
... using the Peters Projection Map
instead of the traditional Mercator.

377
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,431
-Give me 200 bucks and it's done.
-Really?

378
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,148
No. Why are we changing maps?

379
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,111
The Mercator projection has fostered
European imperialist attitudes...

380
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,392
...for centuries and created an ethnic
bias against the Third World.

381
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,068
-Really?
-The German cartographer, Mercator...

382
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,238
...originally designed
this map in 1 569...

383
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,835
...as a navigational tool
for European sailors.

384
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,230
The map enlarges areas
at the poles to create...

385
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,954
...Iines of constant bearing
or geographic direction.

386
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,156
So it makes it easier
to cross an ocean.

387
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,313
But it distorts the relative size
of nations and continents.

388
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,516
-Are you saying the map is wrong?
-Oh, dear, yes. Look at Greenland.

389
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,431
-Okay.
-Now Iook at Africa.

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,991
-Okay.
-The two Iandmasses appear...

391
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,997
-...to be roughly the same size.
-Y es.

392
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,954
Would it blow your mind if I told you
that Africa is, in reality, 1 4 times Iarger?

393
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,758
Yes.

394
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,271
Here we have Europe drawn Iarger
than South America...

395
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,717
...when at 6. 9 million square miles,
South America is almost double...

396
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,876
...the size of Europe's 3.8 million.

397
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,998
AIaska appears three times
as Iarge as Mexico...

398
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,509
...when Mexico is Iarger
by 0. 1 million square miles.

399
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,270
Germany appears in the middle, when
it's in the northernmost quarter.

400
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,711
Wait, wait. Relative size
is one thing, but you' re telling me...

401
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,673
-...Germany isn't where we think?
-Nothing's where you think.

402
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,230
-Where is it?
-I'm glad you asked.

403
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,395
The Peters Projection.

404
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,549
-It has fidelity of axis.
-Fidelity of position.

405
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,673
East-west Iines are parallel and intersect
north-south axes at right angles.

406
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,199
What the hell is that?

407
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,190
It's where you've been Iiving this
whole time. Should we continue?

408
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,388
I'm not saying we'II Iike the answers.
I'm saying we'II give him a chance!

409
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,592
-Now, if you have a question--
-My question is, who elected his boss?

410
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,839
-The people or Kaiser Permanente?
-He's not my president. Let's vote.

411
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,158
-You're having a pretty good time.
-If you do have a question--

412
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,716
-Well, it's not Iike a Y ankee game.
-You suck!

413
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,469
Well, actually, yeah, it's
Iike being at a Y ankee game.

414
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,953
-So, Toby?
-Officer.

415
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,631
Since you' re not really doing anything,
I was wondering, what's this about?

416
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,877
It's about the WT O, Rhonda,
the World T rade Organization.

417
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,078
I get that from the signs
and the newspapers.

418
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,158
The World T rade Organization's
a group of 1 40 countries...

419
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,272
...who have agreed
to a specific trade policy.

420
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,075
-So, what's wrong with that?
-Nothing's wrong with that.

421
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,910
-What would they say if I asked them?
-WT O benefits corporations, not people.

422
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,357
-Doe's it?
-It benefits both.

423
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,873
-Look at them.
-Y eah.

424
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,913
-Philistines.
-Take my nightstick and kick their ass.

425
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,435
Make all the jokes you want,
but Iet me tell you.

426
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,790
They claim to speak
for the underprivileged...

427
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,956
... but in the blackest city in America...

428
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,755
... I'm Iooking at a room with no black
faces. No Asians, no Hispanics.

429
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,752
Where's the Third World
they represent?

430
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,117
Lot of Third Worlders in the Cabinet
Room today, were there?

431
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,073
-You're starting to bother me.
-That's because I'm armed.

432
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,111
No, I Iike that.

433
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,916
I'm going outside.

434
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,635
-Hey, Sam.
-Hey, Charlie, what's going on?

435
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,149
The president Iost his site
for the Iibrary.

436
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,828
-What happened?
-There's an 1 8th-century farmhouse.

437
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,753
-They'II find another site.
-Y eah. Anyway, he's in a mood.

438
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,919
They shouldn't be talking to him about
the Iibrary. We're not going anywhere.

439
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,634
-I think that's what's got him in a mood.
-Yeah.

440
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,276
-Sam, you just got a call.
-Do me a favor and catch the calls.

441
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,554
-I'm gonna Iie down in Toby's office.
-It was the national security advisor.

442
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,399
Well, he's talking about
force protection, right?

443
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,275
I'm sorry, colonel, that was me.
He's talking about force protection?

444
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,268
Right, but the president's gonna ask
me about the readiness issue.

445
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,310
He's gonna want to distinguish
readiness and force protection.

446
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,875
No, that was me again.

447
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,155
I'm the only woman on a conference
call, DeLaney can't tell when it's me.

448
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,397
Do I have a bizarrely
androgynous voice?

449
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,192
Excuse me, I'm gonna step off
for just a minute.

450
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,232
-How you doing?
-Good.

451
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,113
-Good. Drop Daniel Gault.
-Nancy.

452
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,958
-Drop Daniel Gault, do it now.
-Why?

453
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,156
Because I just told you to.

454
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,955
Nancy, I'm a Iawyer. Let's Iet reason
and Iogic have its moment.

455
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,999
-There was one witness.
-Sam.

456
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,510
Earl Lydecker, a Iow -Ievel
State Department staffer...

457
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,429
...who confessed to counterintelligence
officers that he and Gault conspired...

458
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,915
...to send U S. economic
analysis documents...

459
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,156
-...to agents at the Russian Embassy.
-Y es.

460
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,430
-He confessed for no particular reason.
-Y es.

461
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,031
It was demonstrated that Lydecker
was a diagnosed manic-depressive...

462
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,198
...with a history of, wait for it,
institutionalization.

463
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,278
This was the chief witness
for the prosecution. According to--

464
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,754
-Sam.
-Excuse me, please.

465
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,909
According to retired KGB Colonel
OIeg Prosorov, a search of the files...

466
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,635
... reveals only one reference to Gault.
That he was approached in 1 943...

467
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,628
...and Iabeled " highly uncooperative"
and "a poor prospect for recruitment. "

468
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,070
-Sam, Daniel Gault was a spy.
-Oh, my God.

469
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,157
-He was a Soviet spy.
-Based on what?

470
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,511
Cables intercepted by U S. Army
Signal Intelligence in the 1 940s.

471
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,110
Why couldn't the U S. attorney
make espionage in the 1 950s?

472
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,788
The cables weren't decrypted
until the 1 970s.

473
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,993
We cracked some obscure Russian
code and Iearned Gault was a spy?

474
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,553
-Yes.
-That's crap.

475
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,990
If the FBI had proof on Gault,
they'd have told the world.

476
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,318
No, they wouldn't. Neither would
the NSA or Central Intelligence.

477
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,350
You don't show someone you've broken
their ciphers unless you have to.

478
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,430
Gault was Iong dead. Before he was,
he was an agent called BIack Water.

479
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,838
He was a delegate at Y alta. And he
returned to the U S. by way of Rostov...

480
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,793
...where he was awarded
the Order of Lenin.

481
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,276
Y eah, well, I'II believe that
when they show me the file.

482
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,755
-That's not an FBI file.
-It's an NSA file.

483
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,309
I'm classified, but I don't
have code-word clearance.

484
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,953
I know.

485
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,232
I'm not allowed to see that. You can
get into trouble for showing it to me.

486
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,390
I can go to jail for showing it to you,
which obviously I'm not gonna do.

487
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,555
I've blacked out any Iateral reference
that is code-word classified.

488
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,234
Those are the only things
I've blacked out...

489
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,718
...and they are in no way relevant
to your question. Look at me.

490
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,718
-Do you believe me?
-Of course.

491
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,038
Go ahead.

492
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,752
This is Dr. Nancy McNally,
national security advisor.

493
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,113
Again, that's force protection
and not readiness.

494
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,555
So you' re probably wondering what
all this has to do with social equality.

495
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,115
No, I'm wondering
where France really is.

496
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,880
Guys, we want to thank you
very much for coming in--

497
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,310
-Hang on, we'regonna finish this.
-Okay.

498
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,630
What do maps have to do
with social equality?

499
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,795
She asked.

500
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,117
Salvatore Natoli of the National
Council for Social Studies argues:

501
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,155
" In society, we unconsciously equate
size with importance and power. "

502
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,118
-I'm gonna check in on Toby.
-Go.

503
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,709
These guys find Brigadoon
on that map, you'II call me?

504
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,194
-Probably not.
-Okay.

505
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,718
When Third World countries are
misrepresented, they' re valued Iess.

506
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,117
When Mercator maps exaggerate
the importance of Western civilization.

507
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,709
When the top of the map is
the Northern Hemisphere...

508
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,155
...and the bottom is the Southern,
people adopt top and bottom attitudes.

509
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,514
But where else could you put the
Northern Hemisphere but on the top?

510
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,393
-On the bottom.
-How?

511
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,198
Like this.

512
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,554
Yeah, but you can't do that.

513
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,718
-Why not?
-Because it's freaking me out.

514
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,917
It's activist vacation, is what it is.

515
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,718
Spring break for anarchist wannabes.
BIack T -shirts, gas masks as fashion.

516
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,151
These kids today,
with the hair and clothes.

517
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
-AII right, that's it, flatfoot.
-I got great feet.

518
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,593
You want the benefits of free trade?
Food is cheaper. CIothes are cheaper.

519
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,679
Steel is cheaper, cars are cheaper,
phone service is cheaper, feel a rhythm?

520
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,075
I'm a speechwriter.
I know how to make a point.

521
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,952
It Iowers prices, it raises income.

522
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,909
See what I did with "Iowers" and " raises"?
It's the science of Iistener attention.

523
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,238
We did repetition, floating opposites,
now the one that's not Iike the others.

524
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,037
Ready? Free trade stops wars.
And that's it. Free trade stops wars.

525
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,390
And we figure out a way
to fix the rest.

526
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,752
One world, one peace. I'm sure
I've seen that on a sign somewhere.

527
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,436
God, Toby, wouldn't it be great
if there was someone around here...

528
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,872
...with communication skills who
could go in there and tell them that?

529
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,436
-Shut up.
-Toby.

530
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,749
-What are you doing?
-I came to see how it was going.

531
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,958
-How's it going? Josh Lyman.
-Rhonda Sachs.

532
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,513
-Any trouble?
-No.

533
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,429
Josh, the WT O is undemocratic
and accountable to no one.

534
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,596
Decisions are made
by executive directors...

535
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,918
...and the developing world has Iittle
to say about institutional policy.

536
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,193
-What was that?
-I protested to you.

537
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,472
-Why?
-I'm not allowed to get arrested anymore.

538
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,398
-Let's go back.
-No.

539
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,555
I hate these people with the heat
of a nova. Y et here I go.

540
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,076
Attaboy.

541
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,998
-Shut up.
-I got your back, man, you know?

542
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,713
Or not.

543
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,592
Charlie.

544
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,278
Y es, sir.

545
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,074
-Let's do calls in the residence, okay?
-Y es, sir.

546
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,679
There were Iate memos--

547
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,950
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-On your desk.

548
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,718
Thanks.

549
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,070
-I'm gonna head home.
-At 7:30?

550
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,111
I'II make calls from the residence.

551
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,231
-You feeling all right?
-Yeah.

552
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,710
I heard you Iost the site.

553
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,478
What's the backup?

554
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,319
Well, there's this wooded Iand
on the Connecticut River...

555
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,353
... but the Abenaki Indians claim
it's an ancient burial ground.

556
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,518
There's a magnificent bluff
overlooking an orchard in Orford...

557
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,837
...and the owner is willing, if not
eager, to donate the Iand.

558
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,439
What's the problem?

559
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,553
The owner's doing 40 months
at AIIenwood for securities fraud.

560
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,352
You'II find a site.

561
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,916
This is how Iong I get before I have
to start with the Iibrary? Two years?

562
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,315
The first six months was
figuring out the phones.

563
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,751
-They've changed the phones again.
-Yeah.

564
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,757
This is the Iast job I'II have. The Iast
time I'II come to work with people.

565
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,112
I swear to God, I feel Iike I was
just starting to get good at it.

566
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,391
Well, it's two years with
an option for four more.

567
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,679
Mr. President, is there anything
we need to talk about?

568
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,509
-Not yet, okay?
-Okay.

569
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,079
-I'II see you tomorrow.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

570
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,918
Sam?

571
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,314
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.

572
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,790
-Where have you been all afternoon?
-I've been around.

573
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,397
And then I came down here
to practice my sugar tossing.

574
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,310
If you don't practice you might as well
give the clarinet to a kid who'II use it.

575
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,390
Stephanie's upstairs. I put her in
your office because Josh is back.

576
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,355
When she said that from what she's
heard I'm the one to talk to...

577
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,348
...that I have the ear of the president,
you told her to say that, right?

578
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,351
This was so important to her,
I wanted to give her--

579
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,232
Yes, I did. I'm sorry.

580
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,398
I don't know why you would
think I was Iike that.

581
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,471
I mean, for fun, but--

582
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,229
I don't know why you'd think
I was Iike that.

583
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,716
-It was wrong.
-Yeah.

584
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,511
-Were you able to--?
-He was a spy.

585
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,278
-You're sure?
-Yes.

586
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,189
-No, I mean, it's not possible that he--?
-His code name was BIack Water.

587
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,558
He copied by hand State Department
and White House documents...

588
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,639
...and delivered them to the Soviets.
Including RooseveIt's plan to enter WWII.

589
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,628
-You can't tell her. Say something else.
-Possible recruitment targets.

590
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,398
Lists of communists and sympathizers
at the State Department...

591
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,352
...and National Recovery
Administration.

592
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,953
-I'm telling her right now.
-No. No, Sam. PIease, you can't.

593
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,833
Secret memoranda on
the U S. negotiating stance at Y alta.

594
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,395
-PIease stop walking.
-Stalin needed an advantage...

595
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,353
-...we wanted a fair fight.
-Nothing good comes from telling.

596
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,993
-T ruth isn't good?
-Not now, no.

597
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,270
The father's not gonna
Iive three months.

598
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,790
-She asked me to Iook into this.
-I'm saying wait three months or until--

599
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,195
You're in a bad--
Listen to me.

600
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,914
You're in a bad place
and shouldn't make this decision.

601
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,873
You can tell her tomorrow.
If you tell her tonight, that's it.

602
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,833
It was people pushing paper
50 years ago, why doe's it matter?

603
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,277
It was high treason and mattered
a great deal. This country is an idea.

604
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,357
One that's Iit the world
for two centuries.

605
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,558
T reason against that idea is
not just a crime against the Iiving.

606
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,035
This ground holds graves
of people who died for it.

607
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,837
Who gave what Lincoln called "the Iast
full measure of devotion. " Of fidelity.

608
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,194
You understand, the Iast full measure
of devotion to treason against them is....

609
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,879
Sam.

610
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,999
There was a translator in the Hungarian
trade mission named Shaba Demsky.

611
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,350
She was murdered in 1 952.

612
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,314
She was about to reveal the name
of a Soviet agent called BIack Water.

613
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,432
This girl's gonna find out
who her father was.

614
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,598
Sam?

615
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,555
You meant grandfather.

616
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,316
T ell me there's good news.

617
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,990
You ever heard of a woman
named Shaba Demsky?

618
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,719
No.

619
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,792
Sam?

620
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,234
I'm sorry, Stephanie.
I wasn't able to get access...

621
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,631
...to the people I needed
to have it considered this time around.

622
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,839
Why don't you tell your father you'II
be able to try again in three months.

623
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,109
-So you' re open to it?
-Absolutely.

624
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,872
That's all he needed.
That's all I needed.

625
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,511
-Did you hear?
-You should call him now.

626
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,598
-Can I use the phone at your desk?
-Y eah, dial 9.

627
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,033
-Everyone was right about you, Sam.
-Sam's the man.

628
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,755
It's just, there are certain things you' re
sure of, Iike Iongitude and Iatitude.

629
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,751
Sam, I don't know if this is
the best time to tell you...

630
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,875
... but according to C.J., I wouldn't be
so sure about Iongitude and Iatitude.

631
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,948
-Hey. You should have seen Toby.
-He was good?

632
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,749
He blew the doors off the place.
Then I almost got killed.

633
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,430
-How?
-I got hit with a piece of a banana.

634
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,119
-Let's go.
-You know what you are?

635
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,073
-You are old-school.
-Stop talking Iike that. Let's go.

636
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,750
Let me tell you, that was the second
time this year I almost got killed.

637
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,918
Both times I was with you,
so you' re gonna need a new wingman.

638
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,515
-You were my old wingman?
-Y eah.

639
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,597
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

640
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,916
We're gonna get Sam drunk
and then put him to bed.

641
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,236
-I'II come.
-Let's go.

642
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,389
-I'm gonna meet you there.
-Yeah?

643
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,598
AII right.

644
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,074
Dad, it's me.

645
