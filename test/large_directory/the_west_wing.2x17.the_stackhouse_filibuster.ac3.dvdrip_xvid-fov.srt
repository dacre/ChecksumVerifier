00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,992
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,829
I didn't make the decision to run again.
I wouldn't do that without you.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,469
Sometimes I wonder
if I Iistened to you...

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,156
...would I be president right now?
You ever wonder that?

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,873
No, sir. I know it for sure.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,350
-Do you get that you have MS?
-Abbey.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,836
Do you get that your own immune
system is shredding your brain?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,911
I've had one episode in two years.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,278
Mr. President, is there anything
we need to talk about?

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,516
Not yet, okay?

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,555
-- "teaspoon of salt,
one cup of corn flake crumbs.... "

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,957
Dear Dad: First of all, happy birthday.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,630
Second of all, let me explain
why I'm not on my way there right now.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,877
You 're not going to believe this,
but it 's because of a filibuster.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,071
A filibuster that no one ever saw coming.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,556
Not the Senate leadership,
not the party leadership, and not me.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,672
And if you 're angry at me,
well, you 've got a lot of company.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,233
I'm going to explain all this.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,750
Right now, it 's Friday night and
everyone 's trying to get out the door...

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,393
... only I won 't let them.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,679
-- "24 shrimp yield approximately
four to six servings.... "

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,279
T his isn' t happening.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,319
-C.J.!
-Y eah.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,233
-What is he doing?
-It's a recipe for deep-fried shrimp.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,874
-What's he still doing up there?
-He's got a recipe book.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,559
-How Iong will it go?
-I don't know.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,954
How many recipes are there?

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,434
-AII together?
-Y eah.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,154
I can't cook, but I think
there are, Iike, 20 or 30.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,759
-You're screwing with me?
-Y eah.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,518
I'm about to miss the 7:30 shuttle.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,995
If I miss the 8:30,
I miss the train to Sag Harbor.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,236
-Spend the night in New Y ork.
-I've only got 2 nights.

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,829
You gotta see this house.
It's a Frank LIoyd Wright.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,679
-Isn't it cold in Sag Harbor?
-We wear sweaters.

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,949
It's a T ommy Hilfiger ad.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,235
He can't Iast forever.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,796
-He's got 30 recipes he can still read.
-There are more recipes than that.

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,474
Who cares? He's blowing
my weekend in the Hamptons.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,233
He doe'sn't know about the sweaters.

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,314
The reason they needed to stay is, after
the filibuster's over, there 'll be a vote.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,590
And once they vote,
I need my spin boys.

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,994
-C.J.
-I know.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,636
-Who gave him the recipe book?
-We can't blame this on the recipe book.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,195
PIus, I now know the secret
to asparagus Chantilly...

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,753
...is a quarter cup of cream.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,952
I'm going to Port St. Lucie,
which may not mean anything to you...

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,311
-... but it's the spring training home--
-New Y ork Jets. You told me.

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,919
You can watch basketball on TV.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,111
Y es, except the Knicks
are a basketball team.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,959
The Jets are a football team,
and Port St. Lucie...

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,311
-...is the spring training home of the--
-Mets! Y es, damn it, I'm inadequate.

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,317
A weekend at spring training, C.J.

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,671
Mike Piazza is gonna be standing
in the batting cage.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,038
He's gonna turn and see me,
he's gonna say, " Dude. "

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,754
I wouldn't want you to miss
a Iegitimate dude sighting.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,116
-So I can take off?
-No.

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,749
Why do I need the spin?

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,714
Because it's a bipartisan bill and
I'm all for it as long as we get the credit.

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,797
So I've taken the press corps hostage.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,434
-C.J.!
-Guys, I'm sorry, but you know what?

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,675
Listen. Seriously.

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,714
You're Iooking at democracy at work.
It's a beautiful thing.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,275
How much more beauty
can we be expecting tonight?

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,432
-I wouldn't think it'd be much Ionger.
-He's got a recipe book.

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,033
How many recipes can there be?

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,073
I'm supposed to have dinner
with my girlfriend. She's gonna kill me.

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,513
This is just the thing that can cleanse the
palate of a relationship that's gone stale.

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,358
We've been going out for 3 weeks.

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,790
And she's already bitching
about dinner? Lose her.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,911
-C.J.!
-Listen up, everybody!

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,118
This was unforeseen.
Obviously, he's gotta finish sometime.

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,436
When he doe's,
there'II be a vote immediately.

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,394
Then the president will make his calls,
staff will be available for comment...

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,756
...and most important,
you will write about it.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,878
In the meantime, I say pizza
for everybody. Who's with me?

77
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,919
Excellent!

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,596
We're gonna need a truckload of pizza
and some Cuervo 1 800 if we've got it.

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,153
-How much?
-Just enough for me.

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,070
-I need to be at T elluride in the morning.
-That's a rough assignment you pulled.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,669
No, I'm saying I already missed
the 6: 50 to Denver...

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,270
... but I can catch an 8:40 from National
if I change planes in Chicago.

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,517
And as your travel agent,
it's important you update me on that.

84
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,598
I'm supposed to be on my way
to Napa for my dad's 70th birthday.

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,074
-You hear me complaining?
-You just did.

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,833
Get out.

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,075
-It's your dad's 70th birthday?
-Y eah.

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,233
You doing anything?

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,358
We're all getting together in Napa.

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,955
-I meant right now.
-No, I'm sitting and waiting.

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,469
I'm ordering pizza.
I'm catching up on e-mails.

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,268
AII right.

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,634
I got a basketball game on
in my office if you wanna come.

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,632
-Jets and the Mets?
-Nets and the Hawks.

95
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,435
-Jets and the Mets?
-I know, I'm joking when I do this.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,829
Okay.

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,552
You know, there's a 9:00 to SFO.
You can drive to Napa.

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,313
Y eah.

99
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,399
AII right.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,553
I'm in my office.

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,754
It'II end.

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,955
You have any idea
how many recipes there are?

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,792
I really don't.

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,713
"A pack of frozen chicken livers...

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,439
... a teaspoon of dry mustard.... "

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,474
The press is in the briefing room, staff's
in the west wing and I'm right here.

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,513
I'm betting when you read this,
you 're gonna be glad I stayed.

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,396
You 'll end up rooting for a Minnesota
senator named Howard Stackhouse.

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,639
Because I gotta tell you,
this doe'sn 't seem like any old filibuster.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,993
It 's our first filibuster,
and I'm not a rules expert...

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,555
... but the rules of a filibuster
are simple enough:

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,399
You keep the floor
as long as you hold the floor.

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,953
What doe's that mean?

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,232
It means you can 't stop talking ever.

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,352
You can 't eat and you can 't drink,
which is fine...

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,552
... because you can 't leave the chamber
to use the bathroom either.

117
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,354
But all that 's nothing compared to this:

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,915
You 're not allowed to sit down.

119
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,598
You 're not allowed to lean on anything,
or for that matter, anyone.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,430
It started with a bill you 'll read about
tomorrow called the Family Wellness Act.

121
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,791
Josh had been leading staffers
from the Legislative Liaison Office...

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,673
... in negotiations with
the conference chairman for weeks.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,316
And last Monday morning, he walked
into the Roosevelt Room and said:

124
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,919
We got the Family Wellness Act.

125
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,075
-It's done?
-Y es.

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,953
-What'd we get, what'd we Iose?
-We got most of Title VII.

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,237
-That's infant hearing Ioss?
-We got hearing tests for every child born.

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,471
-What about--?
-We didn't get hearing tests...

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,319
-...for those not born in hospitals.
-We can Iive with that.

130
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,551
The Special Needs
Adoption Awareness Program?

131
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,751
This is a campaign
to provide information...

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,315
... regarding the adoption
of special-needs children.

133
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,949
-How did we get it?
-By requiring health care staff...

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,594
...to give pregnant women
information about adoption...

135
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,195
...on an equal basis
with all other courses of action.

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,595
National Organization for Women
will hate that.

137
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,398
-I know.
-Women seeking abortions...

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,192
...shouldn't be required
to be Iectured at.

139
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,715
-You're gonna help me out there, right?
-I will.

140
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,388
I will once again betray the sisterhood.

141
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,640
I saw you, you, you
and you roll your eyes.

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,831
-You weren't even Iooking at me.
-I felt you.

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,117
We're done. Josh Lyman, everybody.

144
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,755
Nice job.

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,633
-I know, I'm thinking about turning pro.
-Y eah?

146
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,638
I got agents telling me
I could go high in the second round...

147
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,512
... maybe Iow in the first
if I have a good post-season.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,392
You don't want to stay in school?

149
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,318
No, I'm white. Nobody's gonna mind.

150
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,710
Josh, this Iooks good.

151
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,878
I mean, he stuck sunsets
on a bunch of small-ticket items, but--

152
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,672
That's the way it's gonna happen.

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,474
You just spent $6 billion on health care,
how do you feel?

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,713
I'd feel better if it meant I could go to
a doctor without filling out a clipboard.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,154
AII right, what else?

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,397
Philip SIuman, chairman
of the Petroleum Producers of America...

157
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,955
...testified yesterday to the FT C:

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,836
"The Bartlet administration's relentless
pursuit of stricter emissions standards...

159
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,031
...in the form of additives Iike MTBE...

160
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,397
...is a big reason we've seen price hikes
in parts of the country. "

161
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,551
The energy secretary's gotta respond.

162
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,758
He's gonna respond, and I'd Iike to
mention that to the vice president.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,433
-You want me to do it?
-I got it.

164
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,551
-He's gonna be pretty unhappy.
-Y eah.

165
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,199
-Anything else?
-No.

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,873
-No.
-No, sir.

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,715
Thank you.

168
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,876
So there it was,
the Family Wellness Act.

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,198
An omnibus health bill aimed at diseases
that disproportionately affect children.

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,590
This was a good day
because something got done.

171
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,995
The problem is,
we only thought it was done.

172
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,873
Dad, this would be a good time
to mention that it 's possible...

173
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,516
... that an Egyptian cat goddess named
Bast has put an ancient curse on me.

174
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,675
C.J.

175
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,835
-Charlie.
-Listen.

176
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,109
-May I call you Chip?
-No.

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,275
-Chipper?
-No.

178
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,435
-Gilligan?
-Listen.

179
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,473
-Hassan AIi is coming this week.
-He's got 38 wives.

180
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,035
Imagine being the girl he dated
who he didn't marry.

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,559
-Hassan AIi is coming?
-Yeah.

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,070
On the president's trip to Cairo,
AIi gave him a gift, a ceramic statue.

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,117
The State Department
told the Office of Protocol...

184
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,550
...it's important it be displayed
when AIi visits.

185
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,035
-Display it.
-Well, they weren't able to find it.

186
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,271
-T alk to the gift officer.
-They did.

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,198
-And?
-They say you have it.

188
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,358
-I'm sorry?
-Sherry Halpern, the gift officer...

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,790
...said she handed it to you in Cairo.

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,551
-Did you say a small ceramic statue?
-Y eah, of a cat.

191
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,194
Okay.

192
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,199
Okay.

193
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,752
-Okay.
-C.J.?

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,195
-You know anything?
-I'II have to think about it.

195
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,994
I don't have instant recall
of every ceramic cat statue...

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,633
... I've ever been handed in Cairo.

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,713
-Should I tell them--?
-T ell them I'm searching my recollection.

198
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,638
Their recollection seemed pretty good.

199
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,398
-Leave me now.
-Sure.

200
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,597
-Toby?
-I'm going to see Hoynes, talk Iater.

201
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,631
-Okay. Carol?
-What do you need?

202
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,435
Some information. Possibly a disguise
and a fast getaway car. Come inside.

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,910
T ell me, how did they
not anticipate the flooding?

204
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,917
There was an unexpectedly high
snowmelt.

205
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,430
The snow fell months ago. Did they
not think it was gonna melt this year?

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,631
-Thank you, everybody.
-Thank you so much.

207
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,239
-Thank you.
-It was a pleasure.

208
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,557
-Thank you. Beautiful quilts.
-Thank you very much, sir.

209
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,672
-The temperatures were warm Iast month.
-We don't know why.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,269
It could have had something
to do with the sun, right?

211
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,595
-Sir?
-We're done. Y eah?

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,671
-Can you see Toby Ziegler?
-Y eah.

213
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,475
25 million acre-feet of water, Candy.
That's 8 trillion gallons.

214
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,716
-Hey, Toby.
-Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

215
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,713
The California Aqueduct is twice
the Iength of Pennsylvania.

216
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,111
-I knew it was pretty big.
-What do you need?

217
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,279
Philip SIuman, testifying yesterday
in front of the FTC...

218
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,308
...charged that it was the White House's
pursuit of tighter emission standards...

219
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,592
-...that's caused the rise in prices--
-SIuman had a good point.

220
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,595
Mr. Vice President, I don't want
to go round and round on SIuman.

221
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,233
He had no point.

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,715
Policy forces them
to use expensive additives...

223
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,593
-...whose benefits are questionable.
-It's price gouging.

224
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,912
It costs marginally more to refine
the fuel with the additives...

225
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,795
...and the cost is being passed on to
the consumer at an outrageous markup.

226
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,156
If a refinery shuts down...

227
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,591
...if there's a fire, which isn't
out of the question with petroleum...

228
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,155
... production comes to a halt,
gas becomes scarce.

229
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,271
The prices go up.
Then they come back down.

230
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,399
Well, it's good to know the companies
can make it through the Iean times.

231
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,990
Anyway, sir, tomorrow night Bill
T rotter's gonna be delivering a speech...

232
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,751
...to the Detroit Economic Council on
" Energy Efficiency in the 21 st Century"...

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,715
...and we'II rewrite the draft to include
a strong rebuttal to SIuman's remark.

234
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,431
-You shouldn't have Bill T rotter do it.
-Why?

235
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,915
His rants against the oil companies
have become familiar.

236
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,997
-The press stopped writing about him.
-Still--

237
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,835
It's also pretty dicey political terrain
for the energy secretary.

238
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,435
-Who would you send?
-T o punch back?

239
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,312
Me.

240
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,989
Really?

241
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,679
I'm having a press conference...

242
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,474
...to announce an advisory group
for the antitrust policy.

243
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,353
I'II take questions at the end,
open it up for anything.

244
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,472
And they will ask me
about SIuman and oil.

245
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,519
-Mr. Vice President--
-If you think I'II be too soft...

246
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,199
...stand in the back of the room.

247
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,234
If you don't Iike what I say, call T rotter
and say you' re on for tomorrow night.

248
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,873
Would you mind if
I prepared some notes for you?

249
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,278
Oh, not at all. Would you mind
if I shoved them up your ass?

250
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,679
No, sir. I....

251
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,310
Well, thank you, sir, we appreciate it.

252
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,195
-I heard you got the Family Wellness Act.
-They' re scheduled to vote Friday at noon.

253
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,112
You'II have the bill by 1 2:05.

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,278
"Six egg yolks,
three cups of heavy cream.

255
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,232
Six tablespoons of sugar.... "

256
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,319
I'll get back to the cat story
because I have to interrupt to say this:

257
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,353
If you ever have a free two hours
and are so inclined...

258
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,030
... try standing up without leaning
on anything and talking the whole time.

259
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,071
You won 't make it. I wouldn 't make it.

260
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,192
Stackhouse wasn 't
supposed to last 15 minutes.

261
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,510
He 's 78 years old. He has a head cold.

262
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,597
This bill is gonna pass. He has no hope.

263
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,837
To say nothing of I can 't imagine
what it is he 's fighting for.

264
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,032
Stackhouse wasn 't
supposed to last 15 minutes.

265
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,597
--that is how you prepare
Virginia green apple pie.

266
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,829
Let 's turn now to David Copperfield.

267
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,677
Well, somebody forgot
to tell Stackhouse, Dad...

268
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,992
... because he just went into
hour number eight.

269
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,673
"-- whether that station will be held
by anybody else, these pages must show.

270
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,432
To begin my life
with the beginning of my life...

271
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,469
... I record I was born,
as I have been informed and believe...

272
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,796
... on a Friday at 1 2:00 at night.

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,719
It was remarked
that the clock began to strike...

274
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,232
... and I began to cry simultaneously. "

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,431
-Hey.
-Hey.

276
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,355
What are you doing?

277
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,196
Well, it's a Iittle complicated and indeed
difficult to explain in Iayman's terms.

278
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,474
You can put the black seven
on the red eight.

279
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,389
Thanks.

280
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,995
Hey, Sam, who's your favorite writer?

281
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,154
Toby.

282
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,437
Who's your favorite fiction writer?

283
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,029
-You're Iistening to him right now.
-You Iike Dickens?

284
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,952
Y eah.

285
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,030
You know,
I never got a chance to say....

286
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,074
I mean, I feel bad
about your dad and everything.

287
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,519
We're doing better.

288
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,472
You know, the ice is starting to thaw.

289
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,557
I'm in the middle of an e-mail
to my father.

290
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,274
-Do you talk to him a Iot?
-Not enough.

291
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,272
You're gonna miss the Iast plane.

292
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,630
I'II take Amtrak to Penn Station
and rent a car.

293
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,792
Okay. Well, I just came down
to get this coffee.

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,672
Go back to your e-mail.

295
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,390
Hey, did I hear you got spanked
by some 1 4-year-old kid...

296
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,068
-...interning at the GAO?
-I did not get spanked.

297
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,759
And she was 1 9 years old...

298
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,794
...and I demonstrated once again
that I am open to all forms of debate.

299
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,871
-With an intern?
-If need be.

300
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,035
Okay.

301
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
-She was very crafty.
-Who?

302
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,034
-The intern from the GAO.
-Y eah.

303
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,750
-Go back to your e-mail.
-I am.

304
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,589
-I'm taking my coffee with me.
-I'II see you upstairs.

305
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,392
"Then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother...

306
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,513
...Iike one who was accustomed
to be obeyed, to come open the door.... "

307
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,199
Dear Jackass.

308
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,834
" 'Mrs. David Copperfield,
I think, ' said Miss Betsey...

309
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,510
... the emphasis referring to my mother's
mourning weeds and her condition...

310
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,518
... not having been lighted, indeed,
since my father's funeral. "

311
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,039
Dear Dad:

312
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,752
C. J. Cregg is writing an e-mail to her
father to kill time during the filibuster...

313
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,112
... and it reminded me I haven 't told you
any tales in the last few weeks.

314
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,992
Let 's start again, okay?

315
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,952
Here 's one about how I got yelled at...

316
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,516
... by a 19-year-old intern
from the General Accounting Office.

317
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,237
Josh was having his twice-weekly
meeting with assistant deputies.

318
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,796
He was basically staffing out
inbox material for the next few days.

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,672
I was looking for a good piece of fruit.

320
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,555
Write this down. Find out if sufficient
funds have been appropriated...

321
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,797
...to the FAA to begin work
on data-Iink communications.

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,073
-They'II ask what sufficient funds mean.
-That's when you get me on the phone.

323
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,309
-What are you doing?
-Looking for a piece of fruit.

324
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,915
Can we show you something
from the back, or...?

325
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,429
-I'm fine.
-Okay, here's one.

326
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,312
The White House has been instructed
by Congress to compile a Iist...

327
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,114
...of 400 government reports
that should be eliminated...

328
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,233
...as they serve Iittle purpose and cost
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

329
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,318
We'II assume,
though the modifier was dangling...

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,479
...they mean the reports serve
Iittle purpose, not Congress itself.

331
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,557
-Who wants to Iead it?
-I will.

332
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,870
You're not in this meeting.
You're shopping for fruit.

333
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,036
I'm done with the fruit.
I was Iistening to you.

334
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,918
-You want to do this?
-Absolutely.

335
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,599
-Why?
-Because it's insane!

336
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,360
We got over 3000 reports
from federal agencies Iast year.

337
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,109
Agriculture spent $40 million
producing 280 reports.

338
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,670
Four years of college, three years
of Iaw school, I spent $30 at Kinko's.

339
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,917
-Give me the thing.
-AII right, we'redone.

340
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,512
Let me tell you something.
The GAO needs a Iittle housekeeping...

341
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,433
...and that's my nickname, okay?
I'm "The Housekeeper. "

342
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,518
-God, that's a terrible nickname.
-Well, start getting used to it.

343
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,076
-Let me talk to you a second.
-I'm not going with that anymore.

344
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,269
I was just with Hoynes.

345
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,232
About SIuman's testimony?
What'd he say?

346
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,550
-He defended it.
-Isn't that what you expected?

347
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,035
-Did you tell him Bill T rotter was gonna--?
-Y eah.

348
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,236
He said he wanted to do it himself.

349
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,353
-Really?
-Y eah.

350
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,515
I don't understand.

351
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,518
He said he's doing a press conference
tomorrow on antitrust...

352
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,597
...and he'II take questions at the end.

353
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,429
They'II ask about the SIuman testimony
and he'II step up.

354
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,871
-Well, somebody's gotta be there.
-Oh, I'm gonna be there.

355
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,110
If he ducks, T rotter goes on in Detroit.
But is it clear to you what he's doing?

356
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,878
No.

357
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,433
Me neither.

358
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,355
Okay, so I got a team together
and I went about the task...

359
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,677
... of recommending 400 government
reports for elimination.

360
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,388
-Report on Pell Grants for the incarcerated.
-What's that?

361
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,234
-Education scholarships for prisoners.
-Wasn't that terminated?

362
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,998
-But we write reports anyway?
-Y eah.

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,236
-Lose it.
-Report on the study of Route 66.

364
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,395
Which tells us?

365
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,068
Condition and traffic flow
of America's oldest highway.

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,390
Anything I don't get from the song?
Lose it.

367
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,715
Excuse me?

368
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,876
-I didn't say anything.
-You made a sound.

369
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,076
-I'II be out of your way in a moment.
-Okay.

370
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,953
Apparently there are tiny mussels
taking over the Great Lakes.

371
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,349
Lose it.

372
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,439
-Can I help you?
-No, you' re screwing the world up.

373
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,876
-Who are you?
-I'm an intern at the GAO.

374
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,715
-It's almost noon. They'II start the vote.
-Let's go watch.

375
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,078
You stay a second.

376
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,353
-You're an intern?
-Y es.

377
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,875
-What are you, 1 4 years old?
-I'm 1 9 years old.

378
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,270
And what's your problem
with my cutting reports?

379
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,357
Nothing, other than it being
utterly bogus.

380
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,152
-What's your name?
-Winnifred Hooper.

381
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,197
-Should I call you "Winnie"?
-If you want me to spit at you.

382
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,714
-I don't.
-Okay.

383
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,111
The accounting office tells me
I can save taxpayers $3 million...

384
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,469
... by cutting 400 reports.

385
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,917
Now families can realize their dream of
a college education for their children...

386
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,315
...with the penny and a half
you just saved them.

387
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,875
You blow through these
Iike they don't mean anything.

388
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,354
-They don't.
-You're an idiot!

389
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,390
-Hey, you' re talking to senior staff.
-Gee, genuflect when you say that, fella.

390
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,353
" Report on the Obstacles to State
and Local T raining Needs...

391
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,471
...in Waste Management
and Resource Recovery. "

392
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,835
-Know what this is?
-Y es.

393
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,390
-Career opportunities for garbage men.
-And what's wrong with that?

394
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,068
It's a tough sell,
and I don't need a report to tell me.

395
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,716
Do you have any idea how much MSW
this country generates in a single year?

396
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,871
-That's....
-Municipal solid waste.

397
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,671
-I knew that.
-209 million tons of MSW...

398
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,996
...or 4.3 pounds per person per day.

399
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,078
And we only have hard data
available from five years ago.

400
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,874
-So they would be even higher today?
-You bet they would.

401
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,117
T rash collectors play an incredibly
important role in our society.

402
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,598
They start work at 4 a. m. A three-person
crew services 1 200 homes in six hours...

403
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,552
...collecting 50,000 pounds of garbage.

404
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,949
How do you know all that?

405
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,435
-I've read the report.
-You've read the report?

406
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,159
-Y es.
-Why?

407
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,352
-I'm allowed. Anybody's allowed.
-No, I mean, why?

408
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,710
Well, they' re all sitting
in the room I work in.

409
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,593
So it just happens you read
the report I pulled off the top?

410
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,234
-I've read them all.
-You've read them all.

411
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,435
I Iike to read.
They Iet me come early and stay after.

412
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,911
Mr. Seaborn, because of
the Iow rate of unemployment...

413
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,792
... people can be a Iot more choosy...

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,468
...and the sanitation departments
are having trouble...

415
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,477
... hiring qualified trash collectors...

416
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,989
-...which I think you'II agree we need.
-Y es.

417
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,668
Okay. I have to go back to my room.

418
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,237
Winnie. Y eah, I said it.
Listen, you' re talented.

419
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,795
When you get out of school,
come see me for a job.

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,560
I suppose you' re not a complete Ioser.

421
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,236
And you write very well.

422
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,310
So when I get out of school,
you should come see me for a job.

423
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,589
Back to the cat story.

424
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,519
I've done my research,
and sure enough, I was quite screwed.

425
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,234
I was in trouble and I needed
to tell someone, a cohort.

426
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,795
Someone whose criminal mind
was equal to my own.

427
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,396
-Donna, I need to talk to you right now.
-I have to get these to people.

428
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,797
-So we went to Cairo Iast year, right?
-Not me. I had strep.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,355
-I didn't, which is sad for me.
-Are you in trouble?

430
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,790
-I may be in a spot of trouble.
-What happened?

431
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,630
Hassan AIi gave the president a gift,
a small ceramic statue of Bast.

432
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,671
-Bast?
-Bast. A cat goddess. She was--

433
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,438
-Did Josh Ieave?
-He went to Iunch.

434
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,392
She was the patron saint of Bubastis...

435
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,319
...and rose to prominence
during the 22nd Dynasty.

436
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,033
-How do you know this?
-I Iooked it up.

437
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,071
-The cats in the temple--
-What temple?

438
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,236
The T emple of Bubastis maybe,
I don't know.

439
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,150
The cats in the temple wore jeweled
collars. They were treated royally.

440
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,874
They thought cats controlled
the movement of the moon.

441
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,071
They had total authority
over royal houses...

442
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,350
... because of their ability
to see in the dark.

443
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,790
Anyone who killed a cat
was put to death.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,833
-I'm sorry, C.J., I'm not--
-I broke the damn statue.

445
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,593
Not badly...

446
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,632
... but, you know, in several pieces.

447
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,758
Since it came out of his collection,
breaking it would amount...

448
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,155
...to a personal affront
implying he had bad taste...

449
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,510
...and that it was of Iittle value
to the president.

450
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,796
They' re asking for you
back at your desk.

451
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,912
-How did you break it?
-I tossed it in my suitcase.

452
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,390
-You tossed it?
-Do you know how much crap...

453
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,352
...gets stuck in the president's hands?

454
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,318
Didn't the gift officer
know it was priceless?

455
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,672
Apparently not, because she handed
it to me with T-shirts and baklava.

456
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,108
-Donna?
-Y eah.

457
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,033
-Why are you telling me?
-I thought maybe you'd have an idea.

458
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,710
There's nothing I can think of, except
agree you' re monumentally screwed.

459
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,990
-I hate to Ieave it at that.
-But you' re gonna.

460
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,270
-What's going on?
-It's this phone message for Josh.

461
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,754
-From?
-Howard Stackhouse.

462
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,552
Who has my wallet?

463
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,988
Thank you.

464
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,553
Josh.

465
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,031
Did Stackhouse ask you
to meet with one of his aides?

466
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,633
-I'm not taking it.
-Why?

467
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,479
He wants an amendment added
to the Family Wellness Act...

468
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,193
...for autism care and research.

469
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,079
-And we don't want to?
-This is a " Christmas tree bill. "

470
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,198
Everyone hangs amendments on it.
We just closed it this morning.

471
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,358
-We try and hang a star on top--
-The tree topples and it doe'sn't pass.

472
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,750
Stackhouse doe'sn't have
a Iot of muscle on this, so--

473
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,154
You got this phone message.

474
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,112
-From his office?
-From him.

475
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,676
" Meet with me or there's not gonna
be a vote while I'm alive. Stackhouse. "

476
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,959
"--as if it were her fault, poor thing,
and said, sobbing, that indeed...

477
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,839
...she was afraid she was
but a childish widow. "

478
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,794
Maybe it's the curse of Bast that made us
not take the Stackhouse threat seriously...

479
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,753
... but whatever the reason,
it 's time to take it seriously...

480
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,678
... because he 's gassing me
out of time.

481
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,269
I've got two hours
till the 1 1 :00 print deadline...

482
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,751
... and there 's no way, there 's no way,
he goes another two hours.

483
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,355
Let 's move on
to the rules of cards.

484
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,791
There' s no way.

485
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,069
The message was pretty cryptic, like
something you 'd slip to a bank teller.

486
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,875
And it was unusual to get it from a
senator who 'd normally dispatch an aide.

487
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,911
Leo agreed,
but was in no way concerned.

488
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,714
He told me to take the meeting,
but not to sweat it...

489
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,718
... and under no circumstances
give anything away.

490
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,394
So I headed up to the Hill wearing,
by the way...

491
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,637
... the new shoes you bought me
which I'd never worn before.

492
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,791
Since Dad's not here to do it, I think
it 's my job to bore you with history now.

493
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,072
The filibuster's been a part of
parliamentary stratagem...

494
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,470
... for over 150 years.

495
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,831
The reason we weren 't
sweating Stackhouse...

496
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,917
... is that he isn 't someone you sweat.

497
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,634
He 's been around forever,
but he has little influence...

498
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,916
... Iittle power and few friends.

499
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,870
So Dad would want me to tell you
where the word "filibuster" comes from.

500
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,949
It 's from the Dutch vrijbuiter, which
translated literally means "freebooter. "

501
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,469
But what they meant was "buccaneer. "

502
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,235
-Afternoon, senator.
-Afternoon.

503
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,509
-Sounds Iike a bad cold.
-It' s fine.

504
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,835
Are you taking anything?

505
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,389
I don't want to talk about my cold.

506
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,398
-I want $47 million to fight autism.
-Sir--

507
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,637
Five centers of excellence
at universities around the country...

508
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,990
...to help scientists coordinate
their research.

509
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,636
Three special units for autism
epidemiology at the CDC...

510
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,474
...and a centralized facility
for gene and brain banking.

511
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,318
-That's 43 million.
-Senator--

512
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,318
The other 4 million
is for a federal program...

513
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,115
...to educate doctors to reduce the
staggeringly high percentage of cases...

514
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,231
...in which autism is misdiagnosed.

515
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,232
-We can't do it.
-Of course you can.

516
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,359
-You simply call the conference chair--
-The bill started out at 2 billion.

517
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,028
-It's 6 billion now.
-That's right.

518
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,748
-So another 47 million hurts you how?
-Sir--

519
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,391
It's 8/1 0 of one percent of a bill aimed
at health issues affecting children...

520
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,235
...which is the same as the percentage
of children affected by autism.

521
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,436
I don't need to tell you,
in these negotiations--

522
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,758
In these negotiations about a bill aimed
at health issues affecting children...

523
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,238
...we've allocated funds for AIzheimer's,
glaucoma and erectile dysfunction.

524
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,632
You know a Iot of 2-year-olds afflicted
with that horrific condition, do you?

525
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,796
There's no doubt that
that's a good point.

526
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,117
But in order to ensure that more
important things were in the bill--

527
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,432
-So there was a determination made.
-I'm sorry?

528
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,592
A determination was made,
an order of priorities.

529
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,991
Senator, there's gonna be a vote.
The bill's closed.

530
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,509
Open it back up again.

531
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,799
That would mean to postpone the vote
and everyone's breaking for the recess--

532
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,032
And you want the story
before everyone goes home.

533
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,989
Y eah.

534
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,868
Okay.

535
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,074
Sir, the next time around,
and there will be a next time around--

536
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,838
That's all. I'm done with you now.

537
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,189
And that was that.

538
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,154
Also at this hour, parliamentary
procedure in all of its glory...

539
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,794
...as a Senate filibuster watches
day turn into night...

540
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,309
... and possibly back into day again.

541
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,990
78-year-old Minnesota Senator Howard
Stackhouse stands alone tonight...

542
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,952
... in the well of the Senate chamber...

543
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,833
... as his colleagues,
somewhat impatiently, wait for a vote...

544
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,918
... that was scheduled to take place
more than nine hours ago.

545
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,395
Stackhouse,
who once ran for president....

546
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,635
-Hey, Zack?
-Y eah.

547
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,478
You guys record the news feeds, right?

548
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,513
Could I get the B-roll they' re showing
on the Stackhouse story?

549
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,871
It's 3 or 4 seconds. It's a campaign stop
and his grandchildren are with him.

550
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,310
The voiceover's talking
about his seven grandchildren.

551
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,670
-Sure, what's the problem?
-It's nothing.

552
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,393
-I'II have it sent up.
-Thanks.

553
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,635
Donna.

554
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,116
You're booked tomorrow morning, 8:55,
United, direct to West Palm Beach.

555
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,435
-Which gets in at?
-1 2:58.

556
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,598
It's still a 70-mile drive to Port St. Lucie.
I'II miss the game.

557
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,836
-I thought they weren't playing yet.
-It's an exhibition game.

558
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,635
You're going to see the Mets play another
team in a game that doe'sn't count?

559
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,758
Actually, it's an intra-squad game.

560
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,157
So you' re going to see the Mets play each
other in a game that doe'sn't count.

561
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,679
-Y eah.
-Okay.

562
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,031
There's a flight out of Dulles at 7 a. m.
You change planes in Newark.

563
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,077
I've gotta fly to New Jersey
to get to Palm Beach?

564
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,959
-Look--
-Just make sure that tomorrow morning--

565
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,794
-Mike Piazza calls you "dude. "
-Y es.

566
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,358
What are you doing?

567
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,398
-I'm writing an e-mail to my mother.
-Why?

568
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
T o thank her for
a pair of shoes she sent me.

569
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,358
-Your mother sent you shoes?
-Donna, please try and keep it--

570
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,273
-That is the sweetest thing--
-Donna.

571
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,195
Okay.

572
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,553
Donna says hi, Mom.

573
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,274
Anyway, I didn 't think much
about the meeting.

574
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,835
There are always people
who don 't get what they want.

575
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,399
I was thinking about other things.

576
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,114
Like Toby, I was puzzled
as to why the vice president...

577
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,551
... who made his money from
and champions the oil industry...

578
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,990
... volunteered to admonish
the oil industry.

579
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,670
Sir, I ' m sure you' re aware that
Philip SIuman testified before the FT C...

580
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,674
...that the administration's relentless
pursuit of stricter emissions standards...

581
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,633
...in the form of additives
is why we'reseeing price spikes.

582
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,398
-Y eah.
-Would you comment on that?

583
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,478
Y eah. Our relentless pursuit
of cleaner air standards...

584
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,671
... has resulted in Iower asthma rates...

585
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,997
...and the cleanest air in California
in 50 years.

586
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,909
It costs marginally more
to refine fuel with additives...

587
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,278
... but the costs are being passed on
to consumers at an outrageous price.

588
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,431
-Mr. Vice President.
-Y eah, Chris.

589
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,558
Are you accusing members
of the PPA of price gouging?

590
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,115
Some of these CEOs
are old friends of mine...

591
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,515
... but they do know how to turn a profit.

592
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,672
They'II claim prices will go down
after production increases....

593
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,433
Hoynes just kept hammering away.

594
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,838
And I was reminded how close
he came to being elected president.

595
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,071
Toby said it was an impressive display...

596
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,114
... but couldn 't get past the question
of why he volunteered to do it.

597
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,993
If you wonder what the president
doe's during a filibuster...

598
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,758
... I don 't know. This is our first.

599
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,633
A t the moment, he 's in his private
dining room having dinner.

600
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,593
There 's a famous French chef visiting,
and every time he comes...

601
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,199
... he cooks for the president.

602
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,075
Leo.

603
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,554
-Good eveni ng, sir.
-You busy?

604
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,671
-What do you need?
-Come have dinner with me.

605
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,196
-Why?
-Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight.

606
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,630
-You want to have dinner?
-What's he serving?

607
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,717
-That's your answer?
-I'm just asking.

608
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,111
Well, I can tell you that the man
specializes in a reinterpretation...

609
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,595
...of classic Provencale cuisine.

610
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,910
-Cassoulet, duck with green olives...
-Y eah.

611
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,075
...saffron chicken.

612
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,510
I haven't had a good saffron chicken
in some time.

613
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,796
-Well, don't you think you deserve one?
-Y es.

614
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,998
His specialty is his dessert,
tomate du saltambique.

615
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,198
That's gonna be a big seedless
beefsteak tomato...

616
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,595
...stewed for three hours
in crme de caramel...

617
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,951
-... and stuffed with--
-Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts. And....

618
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,634
-Served on a pomegranate reduction.
-Let' s go.

619
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,796
-Leave the cell phone.
-I'm taking my phone.

620
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,956
We're not Ieaving the building.
People can find you.

621
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,639
-Let's go.
-What's he on to now?

622
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,997
-He's reading the rules of cards.
-Oh, brother.

623
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,635
Don't worry about it.

624
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,877
Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be
a bigger horse's patoot?

625
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,435
I don't know what part
of a horse that is exactly...

626
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,596
... but I've always thought
he was a decent guy.

627
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,791
He's a curmudgeon,
a grouchy old crank.

628
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,036
-So are we.
-You are. I am full of mirth.

629
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,357
He was all over me the first year.
He called me " Bartlet the Inert. "

630
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,913
-It was funny.
-I'm a reformer.

631
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,315
I'm the most Iiberal president
he's served under.

632
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,794
His hero, Hubert Humphrey--

633
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,399
-Shook your hand.
-That's right.

634
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,236
-I feel bad.
-Why?

635
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,159
His wife died a few years ago.
I didn't go to the funeral.

636
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,315
Why?

637
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,829
-I was busy running for president.
-That's right.

638
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,390
- Tomate du saltambique, my friend.
-Y es, indeed.

639
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,715
Good evening.

640
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,309
Hi. Hang on.

641
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,079
They thought I was gonna
be eating with Abbey...

642
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,953
...so we'II just, you know,
pretend there's no candlelight.

643
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,311
Or that we'renot paranoid
homophobes in any way.

644
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,909
Y eah.

645
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,430
Leo, you have a deputy who's,
frankly, a Iot smarter than you are.

646
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,156
-Let him handle it. Who you talking to?
-My deputy. Y eah.

647
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,518
What doe's he say?

648
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,310
-He says there's no end in sight.
-Okay, Iet's eat.

649
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,839
"To get cash for your chips, you have to
go to the cashier's cage of the casino. "

650
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,234
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

651
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,591
I was Iooking at the B-roll they' re
showing on the Stackhouse story...

652
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,360
-...and there's something odd.
-What?

653
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,710
They show two different events
during his Iast campaign...

654
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,480
...and his grandchildren are next to him.
He's got seven.

655
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,069
-What's the problem?
-There are only six in the shot.

656
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,192
I don't think this is what we think it is.
I don't think he's just being ornery.

657
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,755
I think he has a grandson
who's autistic.

658
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,911
Oh, holy hell.

659
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,392
-T ell Josh. Find out for sure.
-Yeah.

660
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,156
-More brandy, sir?
-No, I'm fine.

661
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,950
I hope the first Iady's not feeling ill.

662
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,038
-No, she's up at the Manchester house.
-Very good, sir.

663
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,516
-No, it really sucks, but thanks.
-Y es, sir.

664
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,118
You hear that? He said, "Very good, sir. "
Where do they Iearn that?

665
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,794
-Y eah. I'm sorry?
-Nothing.

666
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,558
I'm sure that was moved for a reason.

667
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,509
We're prepping for a G-8 with Barney,
and we'regoing to T el Aviv.

668
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,871
-I just feel Iike we don't talk anymore.
-T el Aviv is the week after.

669
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,348
What?

670
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,915
See, you' re not even Iistening.

671
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,231
Ben, Iet me call you back.

672
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,755
What's your problem?

673
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,468
I'm just saying we work all day,
then the day's over...

674
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,035
...and we go out to dinner,
and you' re still working.

675
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,869
And, you know, I'm sitting here....
No time to talk.

676
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,828
You know, conversations Iike this
are the reason I got divorced.

677
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,393
No, it's not.

678
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,713
Sir.

679
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,792
What's wrong?

680
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,556
-I made--
-I'm fine, Billy.

681
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,749
I made a deal with Abbey.

682
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,916
Because of my thing.

683
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,319
One term?

684
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,757
My thing, by the way, is the reason
that Hoynes stepped up on oil.

685
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,359
-Because he thinks maybe....
-Y eah.

686
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,439
It was three years ago,
she can't expect--

687
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,713
Y eah.

688
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,273
Y eah.

689
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,432
It's C.J.
Stackhouse has an autistic grandson.

690
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,513
-Let's go.
-C.J., we'recoming up.

691
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,313
-Charlie.
-He's just coming over.

692
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,317
-Thanks. Can we wait?
-Yeah.

693
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,318
Look, one of us is going to have to tell
the president that the statue's broken.

694
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,675
-It's not broken.
-It is broken.

695
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,916
-She Krazy GIued it back together.
-You Krazy GIued it?

696
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,315
I didn't know what it was.
I needed a potpourri holder.

697
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,876
I have the ancient curse of Bast on me,
so get off my back, Sparky.

698
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,156
Okay, but when you tell him,
I'd Ieave out the Krazy GIue.

699
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,038
-And potpourri, right?
-Y eah.

700
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,878
Here we go.

701
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,758
-How doe's he not just tell me?
-Sir.

702
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,838
How doe's he not come to me
and say, "Jed, this is my grandson.

703
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,838
There are Iots more Iike him
and more to come. Can you help us? "

704
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,190
-Because he--
-Damn it, we would've gotten it done.

705
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,318
-Why doe'sn't he tell me?
-He doe'sn't wanna make political hay...

706
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,158
...out of his grandson,
which is commendable.

707
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,072
He's a crank.

708
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,316
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Hey.

709
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,071
-Hey, Donna, you need something?
-She's the one who started sniffing.

710
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,352
That phone message was for real,
he's not gonna stop till he drops.

711
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,999
He might.

712
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,318
Let me tell you something, don't ever
underestimate the will of a grandfather.

713
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,069
We're mad. We don't give a damn. We got
here before you, and they'II be here after.

714
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,874
We'II make enemies,
we'II break Iaws, we'II break bones...

715
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,719
... but you will not mess
with the grandchildren.

716
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,277
There was quite a bit of sugar
in the crme de caramel.

717
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,118
If I told you to screw the print deadline,
what would you wanna do right now?

718
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,471
I'd want to see if there was
a way I could help him out.

719
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,156
Give him some dignity, right?
And give him a rest, he's gonna collapse.

720
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,197
-Y es, sir.
-Screw the print deadline.

721
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,476
Leo, we will talk about
the other thing Iater.

722
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,636
I'm just asking
how we'regonna do this.

723
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,236
-Excuse me.
-The chairman's gonna gavel him off.

724
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,198
Excuse me.

725
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,920
-What are you doing?
-I didn't know if I'm supposed to.

726
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,993
-We usually don't raise our hands.
-Though it's not the worst idea.

727
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,437
The senator's allowed to yield for
a question without yielding the floor.

728
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,194
-What do you mean?
-He's allowed to yield for a question...

729
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,913
...without yielding the floor.

730
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,069
I was in the House,
I know nothing about Senate rules.

731
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,033
Y es, sir, but Josh doe's
and he Iikes to explain things.

732
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,514
I'm pretty sure it's true.

733
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,637
What time is it?
Let's wake up a parliamentarian.

734
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,513
Yeah, but the only people
who ask questions are senators.

735
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,309
-We're gonna get one. Charlie!
-The Senate wants to go home, to vote.

736
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,919
-Y es.
-I wanna call senators.

737
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,192
Start with friends. And after those two,
we'II go on to the other 98.

738
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,395
-Y es, sir.
-Charlie.

739
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,397
-Start with grandfathers.
-Y es, ma'am.

740
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,108
There's no damn holiday for us either.

741
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,635
-We'II be in the dining room.
-C.J., no kidding.

742
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,876
-Make this happen.
-Yes, sir.

743
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,236
Oh, and I broke your statue.

744
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,829
-I don't think he heard you.
-No.

745
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,149
The water peaked
at 3690 feet Iast month...

746
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,351
... because of an uncontrolled
release from Lake Powell.

747
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,358
-You mean the Ieak of Lake Powell.
-I suppose.

748
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,551
-I am going home.
-Good night, sir.

749
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,557
-Good night.
-Mr. Vice President.

750
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,309
-Didn't I do it right?
-No, you did it very well. I appreciate it.

751
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,475
Yeah.

752
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,990
I'm sure you know I was curious
about why you'd volunteer for that.

753
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,155
Yeah.

754
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,920
So I got ahold of some
private polling you've had done.

755
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,509
Oh. Y eah?

756
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,477
A significant number of people are
concerned over your close ties to big oil.

757
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,513
-Well, not anymore.
-Y eah.

758
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,999
But what I was wondering was, why
did you put the poll in the field at all?

759
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,229
Mr. Vice President,
what do you know that I don't?

760
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,274
Toby, the total tonnage
of what I know that you don't...

761
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,278
...could stun a team of oxen
in its tracks.

762
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,072
Good night.

763
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,390
And then came the big moment, Dad.

764
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,595
Everyone was enlisted.

765
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,153
You called whoever you knew...

766
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,238
...and if that didn 't work,
they got a call from the president.

767
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,759
Do I have your word on that?

768
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,713
We 'd been at it 20 minutes,
coming up with nothing until....

769
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,875
Got it!

770
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,231
Senator Tom Grissom of Washington
State was headed to the chamber...

771
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,512
...and everybody started flooding
into the communications bullpen to see.

772
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,191
The problem being Stackhouse would have
to know about rules and procedures...

773
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,873
... and not think
we were trying to screw him.

774
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,112
We stared at 14 different television
sets while calculating...

775
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,033
... the time it would take Grissom
to walk to the floor.

776
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,789
And we were in frozen silence while
we listened to the rules of blackjack.

777
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,558
-- "unless you are counting cards. "

778
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,028
And then it happened.

779
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,635
Point of order, Mr. Chairman!

780
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,878
Mr. Grissom?

781
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,040
Will the senator yield for a question?

782
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,108
Come on.

783
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,039
-Mr. Stackhouse?
-Come on.

784
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,999
T rust me just this once
you grouchy, old son of a bitch.

785
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,438
Mr. Chairman...

786
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,918
...I yield to the senator
from Washington for a question.

787
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,750
My question is in 22 parts
and might take quite a while.

788
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,231
Perhaps you 'd like to sit and
have some water while I ask it.

789
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,759
Y es!

790
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,674
And that was it.

791
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,956
Grissom gave him a rest
and an opportunity...

792
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,395
... to answer some real
questions about autism.

793
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,034
And when Grissom was done,
McNamara took over.

794
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,515
And after McNamara came Gianelli.

795
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,438
Grandfathers, all.

796
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,955
I'll have to finish this now
and go into the press room...

797
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,434
... and explain what happened.

798
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,200
There will be no vote tonight,
and the Senate will go home.

799
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,392
Stackhouse, with our help,
blew the print deadline anyway...

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,071
... there 's really no reason for Josh
not to go back and reopen the bill.

801
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,319
There are so many days where you can 't
imagine anything good will happen.

802
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,758
You 're buried under a fog of partisanship
and self-promotion and stupidity...

803
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,918
... and a brand of politics
that 's just plain mean.

804
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,913
Yes, Hoynes had us nervous
with his admonishment of big oil...

805
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,271
... and the president was making us
nervous too. But that 's for tomorrow.

806
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,398
Tonight, I've seen a man
with no legs stay standing, Dad...

807
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,431
... and a guy with no voice keep shouting.

808
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,835
And if politics brings out
the worst in people...

809
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,156
... maybe people bring out the best.

810
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,636
Because I'm looking at the TV right now,
and damn if 28 U. S. senators...

811
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,876
... haven 't just walked
onto the floor to help.

812
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,718
I'll catch a plane in the morning...

813
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,310
... and if you wouldn 't mind not turning
70 until tomorrow, that 'd be great.

814
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,308
In the meantime, I love you so much.
Your daughter, Claudia.
