00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,233
Tell me what the problem is, Toby.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,909
Previously on The West Wing:

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,877
I'm Sam, sir.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,679
I'm the deputy
communications director.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,077
I'm Leo McGarry,
White House chief of staff.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,958
I'm personal aide to the president.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm the press secretary.
It's an unavoidable conflict of interest.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,634
-You're the communications director.
-I'm a speech writer.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,752
Matter of fact,
I'm the deputy chief of staff.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,196
Which makes me
deputy, deputy chief of staff.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,993
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,195
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,590
Coast Guard, this is San Diego
Port Police boat....

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,348
I need Romero and Rydell
on backup.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,154
I'm checking with the lieutenant.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,198
I'm gonna need them there in 20.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,953
-Repeat, please.
-Need them in 20.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,110
Why the priority?

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,191
- We need a support team out there.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,751
Take these right over there.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,079
Cmdr. Cale?
Joseph Russo, lNS.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,758
It's the container ship Horizon.
We're holding them a half-mile out.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,354
They started from the Fujian province.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,074
-How many?
-Maybe a hundred.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,394
Call the State Department?

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,150
Yeah, we'll need some translators
who speak Mandarin.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,110
We got them.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,431
Are we talking
about expedited removal or--?

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,190
-I'm sorry?
-Are we talking about expedited removal?

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,675
That's not up to me.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,516
"Over three and a half centuries ago,
strengthened by faith...

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,951
...and bound by a common desire
for liberty...

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,230
... Pilgrims sought out
a place in the New World...

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,876
...where they could worship
according to their own beliefs. "

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,070
-And solve crimes.
-Sam.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,792
-lt'd be good.
-Read the thing.

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,237
By day, they churn butter and worship.
By night, they solve crimes.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,034
-Read the thing.
-Pilgrim detectives.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,032
-Do you see me laughing?
-On the inside.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,158
-With the big hats.
-Give me the speech.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,119
Have either of you heard of,
I don't know, the something...

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,112
...the Jamestown
Mayflower Daughters...

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,396
...of the American Revolution
Preservation Society?

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,070
-The Jamestown--?
-I may have gotten the name wrong.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,998
They' re inviting the White House
to participate in some...

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,912
...Thanksgiving Revolutionary War
re-enactment.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,754
Let's not torture American
History completely to death.

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,036
-Who the hell--?
-Jamestown was the 1 6th century.

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,954
The Mayflower landed at Plymouth
in the 1 7th century.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,589
The fathers of the Daughters
of the American Revolution...

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,157
-...fought in the 1 8th century.
-It's a festival feast of some kind.

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,554
Who cares?

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,071
Somebody needs to learn
the meaning of Thanksgiving.

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,593
Re-enactments and proclamations...

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,157
...and Native American corn-husk
hanging contests with native--

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,352
-Corn-husk hanging?
-I'm the Thanksgiving cruise director.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,313
-lt wasn't like this last year?
-I wasn't here.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,398
-Where were you?
-They sent me home.

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,150
You don't remember me
having a 1 01.7-degree fever...

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,038
-...and flulike symptoms?
-No.

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,193
Every time we come up
on a holiday...

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,875
...you check out like seniors
who are done with finals.

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,156
We're writing an important
Thanksgiving proclamation.

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,358
-And a new action-adventure series.
-Nobody here has checked out.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,271
I was just flipping a nickel in my office.
Sixteen times in a row, it came up tails.

66
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,876
-I'm going home.
-Have a good night.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,713
Sixteen times in a row.

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,275
Excuse me. Fellas?

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,390
It's okay.
You can come in here.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,431
Morton Horn from Jasper Farms
in Virginia. T ell them what you're doing.

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,918
-I'm dropping off the turkeys.
-He's dropping off the turkeys.

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,879
Nobody left instructions. He had
a pass for the northwest entrance.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,997
-I'm dropping off the turkeys.
-Yeah.

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,275
Where should I put them?

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,229
-C.J. 's office.
-C.J.

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,035
Definitely put them
in C.J.'s office. Right there.

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,152
-Right here. Donna will show you.
-C.J. handles all the birds.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,357
-C.J.
-Okay.

79
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,149
And, Morton.

80
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,428
Ms. Cregg is gone for the night,
and her office is secure...

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,996
...so let the turkeys
out of the cage...

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,476
...and allow them to roam freely,
as they were meant to do.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,274
-Okay.
-Okay.

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,559
-Show her who's slacking off.
-Pizza?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,876
Josh?

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,235
They need you on the phone.

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,911
A Cmdr. Cale of the Coast Guard
is talking to the watch commander.

88
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,832
-They want you to sit in on the call.
-Why?

89
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,879
-Something about a boat from China.
-Josh Lyman.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,315
It's an 800-foot container ship
called the Horizon.

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,070
Eighty-three Chinese were
stowed away in containers.

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,194
-I heard 96.
-Thirteen of them died on the way.

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,910
-What happened to the dead bodies?
-They came over with the 83 live ones.

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
INS has them in a temporary
detention facility by the water.

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,479
Brief C.J.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,594
-Doing anything for Thanksgiving?
-The first family. You?

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,759
-Toby, Sam and I will watch football.
-Brief C.J. on the Chinese.

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,753
Yeah. Leo, do me a favor,
would you?

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,192
Don't tell the president we're watching
football. He'll invite us for dinner.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,878
Yes. Upon hearing that you're free...

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,668
...the president will insist
that you join him for dinner.

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,794
We've been working hard,
and we'd prefer to watch football...

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,315
...rather than listen to a history
of yam in Latin.

104
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,115
-Brief C.J.
-Yeah.

105
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,037
-Listen.
-What?

106
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,230
About 100 Chinese stowed away
in the cargo hold of a container ship.

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,228
INS has them in a temporary
internment camp in San Diego.

108
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,113
-I'll need more.
-I don't have more.

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,674
I will in a few minutes,
so stay out of the Press Room.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,110
And the recess appointments?

111
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,317
Toby wants to talk to the president
about adding a name.

112
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,274
-Who?
-Josephine McGarry.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,869
-Really?
-Yeah.

114
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,394
Is this as a favor to Leo?

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,876
Toby's sniffing for a fight
on school prayer.

116
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,714
He'll get one. I'm gonna see
what's next for me in this week...

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,198
...of unendurable
Thanksgiving nonsense.

118
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,436
-Hey, C.J.
-Hey, Carol.

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,229
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,110
-The turkeys came.
-Wait, wait! I'm coming.

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,276
-I didn't think you were here yet.
-I am.

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,119
-The turkeys came.
-So Carol said.

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,316
Excuse me.

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,149
Josh, Toby and Sam
said they should go in your office.

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,755
-These are the turkeys.
-Turkeys for what?

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,314
You weren't here last year.

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,717
-When?
-Over Thanksgiving. You were sick.

128
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,189
Every year on Thanksgiving...

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,034
-...the president pardons a turkey.
-He pardons a turkey?

130
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,078
-It's your event--
-Why are there two?

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,516
-I'm sorry?
-Why are there two turkeys?

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,157
-The press secretary decides...
-No!

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,677
...which of the two finalists
is more photogenic.

134
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,515
-Their names--
-I don't wanna know their names.

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,433
This one's Eric, and this one's Troy.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,871
-Eric and Troy?
-Yeah.

137
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,956
I'm to choose the more photogenic of
the two to receive a presidential pardon?

138
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,590
I have a master's degree from
the University of California at Berkeley.

139
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,997
-That's a good school.
-Yeah.

140
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,032
They eat grain...

141
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,991
...or, really, whatever's lying around.

142
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,151
And T roy doe'sn't like to be touched.

143
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,112
-Okay, I'd like to be alone now.
-I understand.

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,154
-Hey, Sam.
-What's going on?

145
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,236
I'm shopping for a new carving knife
for the president.

146
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,352
He takes carving knives
very seriously.

147
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,517
Yes, I've discovered.

148
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,112
I need a few minutes to talk about
the Chinese. Something's going on.

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,356
-What?
-We're just getting it now.

150
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,359
-How'd it go?
-I think I've got it.

151
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,156
-I wouldn't get your hopes up, dear.
-No, this is a very good knife.

152
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,118
-He's particular.
-That's one word for it.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,477
I heard that.

154
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,910
Mr. President.

155
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,872
-I think you'll find these to your liking.
-Yes, yes.

156
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,599
-lndeed I do.
-Excellent.

157
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,429
Chef's Choice.
Twice the amount of carbon...

158
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,190
...which means it'll hold a sharp edge
1 0 times longer.

159
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,517
And you can see the handle,
which is texturized molded polymer.

160
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,393
Has no rivets or air pockets.

161
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,069
I'm glad you' re happy.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,799
-This is an American knife.
-Yes.

163
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,712
-No German knives for us.
-No, sir.

164
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,877
-Good job.
-Thank you.

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,315
Hold on.

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,989
Sir?

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,469
-No, the balance isn't right.
-I'll take it back, sir.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,592
-You know what we need?
-A German knife?

169
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,192
I'll get on it. And, Mr. President,
Sam asked me to give you a heads up.

170
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,078
He'll need a few minutes
to talk about San Diego.

171
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,836
-They already briefed me on San Diego.
-He said there might be something else.

172
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,115
-Thank you.
-Sir?

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,034
The Germans know
how to make a knife, Charlie.

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,634
Josephine McGarry?

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,116
She's been put on a lot of shortlists.

176
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,159
-She's a pretty controversial woman.
-That's not a flaw.

177
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
It is when it's a recess appointment.
Recess appointment...

178
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,828
...assumes the Senate will have
no problem with the nominee.

179
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,720
The Senate's gonna have
a considerable problem.

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,389
That's the Senate's problem.

181
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,036
You wanna have a debate
on school prayer.

182
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,149
-Yes.
-This will start it.

183
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,393
I've gotta say, look, I'm just--
Toby, I'm not wild about the woman.

184
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,195
I've known her for 25 years.
She's All About Eve.

185
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,310
I wouldn't cast her in a play,
but at the Department of Education--

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,155
Wanna have a debate on school prayer?
This'll start it.

187
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,111
-What are we talking about?
-Recess appointments.

188
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,477
-I've got the final list right here.
-Hey, Leo.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,470
"James Elkins, assistant secretary
of T ransportation for Aviation.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,117
Leslie Cryer, assistant secretary
of Commerce for Economic Development.

191
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
Umberto Sepio, deputy
administrator for the EPA. "

192
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,599
-Leo, we'readding a name.
-Who?

193
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,712
-Josey.
-No, no.

194
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,470
Assistant secretary for Primary
and Secondary Education.

195
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,154
-Did my--?
-We want the debate.

196
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,759
My sister call and ask you for this?

197
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,433
-She did not call me.
-I'm amazed.

198
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,030
-She called me.
-Take her name off the list.

199
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,752
It's not patronage if she's qualified.

200
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,072
Which she is. Ph.D. in education,
six years as a principal...

201
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,630
...four years as superintendent
and a significant Democrat.

202
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,071
-They'll bring up school prayer.
-No kidding.

203
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,112
Please don't hop
on the back of Toby's horse.

204
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,919
It'll take you to a fight
we're not geared for.

205
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,515
We are geared for it.
If we're not, we should get out.

206
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,473
Sure. You first.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,070
-I'll take the meetings.
-Take the meetings...

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,476
...and start with aides to the Republican
leadership and gauge exactly...

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,594
...the volume of dumbness
with no reward we can expect.

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,189
Excuse me, Mr. President.

211
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,431
-Take the meetings.
-I'm very happy to.

212
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,996
There's a wrinkle in the situation
in San Diego.

213
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,951
-What is it?
-You're not gonna believe it.

214
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,038
They're claiming they're Christian
Evangelicals fleeing persecution.

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,594
-You're kidding me?
-They're seeking religious asylum.

216
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,794
-You're kidding me?
-No.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
The Christian community will
scream that they've gotta stay.

218
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,079
China's gonna say, "Send them back. "
lNS is gonna say, "The law's the law. "

219
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,432
This is a whole new thing.

220
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,031
Well, the INS conducts something
called a "credible-fear interview. "

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,794
This is not a hearing on whether
or not to grant asylum.

222
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,514
It's to determine if the detainee
has a credible fear...

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,230
...that they'll be harmed
if returned to their country.

224
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,228
Will the White House meet
with the Christian community...

225
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,193
-...to hear their input?
-Yes.

226
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,470
We'll be meeting
with the Rev. Al Caldwell...

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,150
... members of Beijing's Embassy
and lNS agents.

228
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,040
The president asked Josh Lyman
and Sam Seaborn to run these meetings.

229
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,793
It's possible that by week's end...

230
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,475
...we'll have alienated Christians,
China and our government.

231
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,633
That's all I have on the refugees.

232
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,152
I was gonna release the list of recess
appointments, but I'll wait.

233
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,390
The list has been sent
to the committee chairs...

234
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,195
...and one of them will leak it
to you this afternoon.

235
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,397
I remind you
that it's Thanksgiving week...

236
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,992
...which means the traditional
presidential pardon...

237
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,113
...of the chosen turkey.
That will be Wednesday afternoon.

238
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,069
Thursday, the president will make
his proclamation in the Rose Garden.

239
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Among the guests will be
the Boys and Girls Clubs of America...

240
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,352
...and members of Big Brothers
and Big Sisters of America.

241
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,110
-Will you be leading them in song?
-I'm sorry?

242
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,671
The press secretary
usually leads the kids in song.

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,952
Of course
I will be leading them in song.

244
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,589
For I am the press secretary.
Thank you.

245
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,669
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-I gotta learn some songs.

246
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,150
Don't bring it up at the meeting.

247
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,038
-Josh--
-Don't bring it up at the meeting.

248
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,917
The guy threatened to blow up
a theater in the name of God.

249
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,196
-A theater with people in it.
-Yes.

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,596
But sending illegal Chinese immigrants
back to China is objectionable.

251
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,190
Don't bring it up at the meeting.

252
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,677
-lt might slip out.
-Shove it back in.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,309
-Good morning, Rev. Caldwell.
-Morning, Josh. Sam.

254
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,149
-Good morning, Reverend.
-Good morning, everybody.

255
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,998
Welcome. Good morning, Mary.

256
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,595
The White House faces
considerable embarrassment...

257
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,237
...if the president maintains
his stranglehold on indifference...

258
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,354
...when it comes to persecuted
Christians around the world.

259
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,396
Okay, we'redone with good morning.

260
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,035
They are from a country
that oppresses Christians.

261
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,639
The president has to grant
their asylum request.

262
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,276
The president doe'sn't grant
asylum requests.

263
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,074
The lNS judge doe's.

264
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,839
The lNS Judge is gonna do
what the president urges him to do.

265
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,436
If the president doe'sn't urge the judge
to grant asylum, he'll wish he had.

266
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,639
Mary, I swear to God...

267
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,118
...you're not gonna get anywhere
in this building by threatening me.

268
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,674
Do we know that they were
persecuted in China?

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,156
-Excuse me?
-Do we know they were persecuted?

270
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,152
-They' re Christians.
-I believe that.

271
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,391
-I'm asking if they were persecuted.
-Yes.

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,557
How do you know?

273
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,072
They stuffed themselves in 20-by-20 foot
compartments for a month and a half.

274
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,636
Why would they be here?

275
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,032
The leaders of the Fengcheng Church
were thrown into labor camps.

276
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,754
Last August, three T aiwanese-born
American Evangelicals...

277
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,149
...were arrested in Henan province.

278
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,679
For "activities incompatible with tourist
status under which they entered China. "

279
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,158
For spreading the gospel,
100 of their followers were detained.

280
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,679
A woman was beaten
by the police.

281
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,795
Chinese Catholics are being arrested
for recognizing the Vatican's authority.

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,279
An 82-year-old bishop was released after
30 years in prison, then arrested again.

283
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,995
An 84-year-old bishop was tortured
until he passed out.

284
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,352
-He's now in a coma.
-China harasses Christians, Josh.

285
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,031
State Department says so.
Amnesty lnternational says so.

286
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,071
I say so. It is fact.

287
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,911
And the millions of American Christians
and Christians around the world...

288
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,313
...will not stand blithely by
while religious freedom is threatened.

289
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,273
-Sure you will.
-Sam--

290
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,075
They will stand blithely by
while religious freedom is threatened.

291
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,356
-They' re just not doing it this time.
-Okay--

292
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,438
-ls this about the play?
-Guy writes a play...

293
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,077
...called Apostles, in which Jesus Christ
is gay, and you protest. Fine.

294
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,312
When a guy threatens to blow up
the theater, you guys are nowhere.

295
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,718
-That play was disgusting.
-You're committed to religious freedom...

296
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,598
... unless you don't like
what they have to say?

297
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,189
-That's not--
-Don't look...

298
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,151
...but the playwright's
headed to China.

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,152
Josh?

300
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,958
-Sorry about that.
-No, Sam's right. It's a point well-taken.

301
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,594
I don't wanna get bogged down
in a Mary Marsh mud fight.

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,269
-This is too important.
-Yes.

303
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,075
I want you to know.
I want the president to know.

304
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,397
My church will pay out the bond
for each of the refugees.

305
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,434
-lt might be more money--
-I know how much we'retalking about.

306
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,270
My church will pay it.
If they won't, I will.

307
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,913
Okay, thank you, Reverend.
I'll pass that along.

308
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,753
-Good morning, Toby.
-Good morning.

309
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,798
-You look determined.
-I am, sir.

310
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,553
Good boy.

311
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,112
Before we get to anything else,
I object...

312
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,159
...to the totally crappy way
we were informed about this.

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,038
You knew you were getting
the list of appointments.

314
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,955
-What makes you think--?
-Article ll, Section 2.

315
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,310
"The president shall have the power
to fill vacancies...

316
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,677
...that may happen during the recess
of the Senate...

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,474
... by granting commissions which shall
expire at the end of their next session. "

318
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,473
-You can't just slip her in.
-Slip who in?

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,035
-Don't be cute.
-Can't help it.

320
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,509
McGarry's sister.

321
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,589
It's Mr. McGarry, and her name
is Dr. Josephine McGarry.

322
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,076
She has a Ph.D. in education
from Cornell.

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,039
She's published many scholarly essays
on public education.

324
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,478
Superintendent of the Atlanta School
District, servicing 58,000 students...

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,117
...with some of the highest
standardized-test scores in the country.

326
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,516
What troubles the senators you work for
about her résumé?

327
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,112
-I think you know.
-I do, but I'd like you to say it.

328
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,116
She's anti-religion.

329
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,112
-ls she?
-Yes, she is.

330
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,390
She's on the board of visitors
at her church.

331
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,514
She teaches Sunday mornings
at the lmmaculate Heart of Mary.

332
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,429
You know what we're talking about.
She's against prayer.

333
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,313
-She's against prayer?
-School prayer.

334
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,478
As she's published
in her scholarly essays.

335
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,879
You wanna know who else is against it?
The 1 1 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

336
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,838
Organized prayer in public schools
is prohibited.

337
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,675
Your problem with her is that while
superintendent, she enforced the law.

338
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,714
A law that 70 percent say is wrong.
Seventy percent of people--

339
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,674
Laws don't work like that, Wayne.
We don't ask for a show of hands.

340
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,555
-You understand that the Republicans--?
-No, I don't!

341
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,594
Can you explain to me slowly,
using small words and visual aids?

342
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,391
The Senate Republicans will hold up
the confirmations of other nominees.

343
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,992
This is an abuse of the recess
appointment. It's there for convenience.

344
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,795
It's not there to circumvent the Senate's
constitutional right to confirm nominees.

345
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,271
Neither is the filibuster. I'll put down
my gun when you put down yours.

346
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,917
If you don't think she'd be confirmed,
then it's outrageous--

347
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,596
No, what is outrageous is that this
would never come to vote in session.

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,157
There's no way the Senate could not
confirm her. She's too qualified.

349
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,708
This would never come to a vote.

350
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,149
So...

351
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,077
... hold up appointments,
shut down the government...

352
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,038
... because a teacher did
as she was told.

353
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
You'll give us a second term,
and we don't even leave the building.

354
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,796
But not because I'm right and you're
wrong, though I am and you are...

355
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,793
...but just because I am better
at this than you.

356
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,473
Not this time.

357
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,036
I'm sorry?

358
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,835
You're not better this time.

359
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,233
This is a picture of her.

360
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,509
Doing what?

361
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,996
Enforcing the law.

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,158
At a home game, there was an
organized prayer. She's breaking it up.

363
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,110
Yes, she is.

364
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
-It's not good, but it's not--
-These are high school students.

365
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,400
Two of them are on their knees praying
while being handcuffed...

366
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,831
...with my sister
standing next to the cop...

367
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,469
...whose hand is on his nightstick.

368
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,478
He's resting it on his nightstick.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm sure that explanation
will be in the caption.

370
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,035
One of the students is wearing his
marching-band uniform. One is black.

371
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,079
-Listen--
-You say it's not good?

372
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,519
That's a penetrating diagnosis...

373
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,952
...from the White House
communications director.

374
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,038
-We were aware of the incident.
-We didn't know there was art.

375
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,954
-It's a local paper.
-It's not local anymore.

376
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,150
I can save it.

377
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,229
-Doe's she know she was submitted?
-Yes.

378
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,079
-How?
-I called her.

379
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,519
-I can save this.
-Margaret!

380
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,038
Football game, high school,
marching band, on their knees.

381
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,032
The only thing breaking up
Norman Rockwell...

382
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,311
...are the cops, the handcuffs
and my sister.

383
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,753
Get Josephine on the phone.

384
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,829
I begged you to go slow
with this nomination.

385
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,990
The post needed--

386
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,436
The post did not desperately
need to be filled.

387
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,032
Neither the economy nor national security
nor infrastructure will collapse...

388
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,514
...without an assistant secretary
of Primary and Secondary Education.

389
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,475
-lt brings the problem front and center.
-Great.

390
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,798
-And what prize do we get for that?
-Leo--

391
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,317
What prize do we get
for bringing it front and center?

392
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,275
-Leo?
-What?

393
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,074
Your sister.

394
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,155
I'll be in my office.

395
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,476
It brings your problem
front and center, Toby.

396
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,832
Leave the newspaper.

397
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,194
Hey, Jo.

398
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,151
-Donna?
-Hey, C.J.

399
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,191
Can I borrow you for just a minute?

400
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,635
Hey, C.J.

401
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,152
I'd love to talk with you, but I have
a turkey pardoning in five minutes.

402
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,198
-I thought that was tomorrow.
-T omorrow's the singing.

403
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,599
-You're singing?
-I'm leading the song.

404
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,599
-Excellent.
-I need Donna for a moment.

405
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,350
-You need help with the song?
-I don't need help. Donna?

406
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,108
INS guys will be here in a minute.

407
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,475
-What do you need?
-The song.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,910
Isn't it the usual song?

409
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,753
"We Gather Together"
is the usual song.

410
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,149
-You know it?
-Everybody doe's.

411
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,471
-I don't!
-Didn't you go to elementary school?

412
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,116
Yes. Right before
being a National Merit Scholar.

413
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,390
-The madrigals will know the song.
-The madrigals?

414
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,115
Guys wearing costumes
and playing the lute.

415
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,913
You're not the one
conducting a musical on CNN.

416
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,673
Want me to teach you the song?
Now?

417
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,352
Not now. Right now I have
actual serious work to do.

418
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,070
Okay, showtime, guys.

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,597
I've observed you under a number
of conditions, and this is the final.

420
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,076
I can't have you wigging out
in the president's face.

421
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,270
I don't like the photo, so....

422
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,917
You both did fine.

423
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,316
Troy, I want you to know it was
neck and neck, but I'm giving it to Eric.

424
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,991
You were in it right until the end,
but it's the flapping thing.

425
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,873
It's of some concern to me
that I've been talking out loud.

426
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,633
That's very unsettling.

427
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,037
Okay, Eric, here we go.

428
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,757
Come on, let's go.

429
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,593
You support him
under his hindquarters.

430
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,237
I don't know where his hindquarters are,
and I'm not gonna look that hard.

431
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,555
Come on. Down. Troy.

432
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,588
Passage usually costs anywhere
from 20 to 40,000 dollars.

433
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,395
Forty thousand dollars buys them
a spot in the container?

434
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,070
-How do they have $40,000?
-They don't.

435
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,197
They pay off the smugglers
when they get here.

436
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,431
-They become indentured servants.
-Sweatshops?

437
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,995
Drugs, prostitution.

438
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,192
Al Caldwell and the Christian League
offered to pay their bond.

439
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,278
They should know it's not uncommon
for them to be coached.

440
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,030
-On religious persecution?
-It's a good alibi.

441
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,033
Listen, you gotta be serious
about illegal immigration.

442
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,555
You gotta do these things
within existing laws.

443
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,593
-Thanks for coming by.
-Good seeing you.

444
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,076
-Take it easy.
-You too.

445
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,158
A lot of them left their families.

446
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,358
Two months on the water in a container.
Dead bodies in there.

447
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,154
They had to want it.

448
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,195
Mr. President? We're all set.

449
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,158
-What am I doing?
-Pardoning a turkey.

450
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,674
Okay.

451
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,159
Mr. President?

452
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,714
-Excellent.
-I think you'll like this.

453
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,078
The Messermeister.
Meridian 3000 series.

454
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,755
One-piece forged blade,
riveted POM handles.

455
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,910
T errific.

456
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,798
-I don't like the handles.
-Okay.

457
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,429
-Mr. President.
-How's it going?

458
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,918
We've taken a couple of dozen
meetings in the last two days.

459
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,470
-Met with Chinese Embassy officials?
-Last night. They say--

460
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,279
Christians aren't persecuted
in China.

461
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,712
Since they' re not oppressed,
they don't qualify for refugee status.

462
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,393
Under U.S. or U.N. conditions, yeah.

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,832
They also make the point that they
broke Chinese law when they left...

464
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,549
-...and should be sent back.
-It's a fair point.

465
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,998
The lNS agents also feel
it's not uncommon in this situation...

466
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,595
...for refugees to,
how do I put it...

467
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,998
-...feign faith.
-Yeah, they'll be coached.

468
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,192
-How do you tell between--?
-You guys know what a shibboleth is?

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,150
-It's a catch phrase, isn't it?
-A cliché.

470
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,469
It comes from the Bible.

471
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,112
"Then said now unto him,
'Say now shibboleth.'

472
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,479
And he said, 'sibboleth,' for he
could not frame to pronounce it right. "

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,118
It was a password. A way the army
used to distinguish true lsraelites...

474
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,800
...from impostors sent across
the river Jordan by the enemy.

475
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,230
I'm having one of the Chinese refugees
flown here. I'll meet with him tonight.

476
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,430
Mr. President, I can't--
lndefinitely with a turkey--

477
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,078
Mr. President, what are you gonna ask
the Chinese refugee?

478
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,868
I'm gonna ask him to say "shibboleth. "

479
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,309
-She's here?
-Yeah.

480
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,193
Okay.

481
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,320
I understand they've already
started beating the drums over me.

482
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,115
I don't need to tell you
that I won't shrink from a fight.

483
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,351
No, you don't.
In fact, you look for them.

484
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,916
-Just like my brother.
-I don't look for fights.

485
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,195
They look for me.

486
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,269
I'm trying to stage-manage
an undisciplined White House...

487
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,358
...through a difficult time.

488
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,233
I haven't experienced
an easy one yet.

489
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,194
This is gonna be a big victory
for us, Leo.

490
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,273
I will have support lined up
from the AFT, the NEA. I will--

491
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,679
Josey, I want you to withdraw
your name from consideration.

492
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,989
Why?

493
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,554
You feel you can do more
as superintendent in Atlanta.

494
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,469
-No, I mean, why--?
-Because the president won't...

495
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,116
-...and even if he would, it'd look bad.
-I'm asking--

496
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,637
-They've got a newspaper picture.
-Of what?

497
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,470
-You know of what.
-There are a lot of pictures.

498
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,989
This one is special.

499
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,872
This one is "game's over. "

500
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,553
-The handcuffs?
-Yeah.

501
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,430
And you wouldn't even consider
sticking by me?

502
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,190
A few years ago, on a campaign
swing through the South...

503
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,114
...I met a stringer photographer
named Odabee Jones.

504
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,079
It was an unusual name,
and so I've remembered it.

505
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,115
He told me he had you to thank for
starting his career in photojournalism...

506
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,877
... because you'd give him a heads up
when something's worth shooting.

507
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,033
-Leo, what in God's name--?
-Look at the photo credit on the picture.

508
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,196
You called a photographer.
You wanted a picture taken of that.

509
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,038
Those kids are commendable.

510
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,876
In this day and age,
those kids are phenomenal.

511
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,276
Now we have laws,
and they are difficult...

512
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,713
...and they have to be enforced,
and it's right that they' re enforced.

513
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,709
But we do not strut ever.

514
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,469
Is there something
you need me to sign?

515
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,355
Anything else?

516
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,550
Kiss your kids hello for me.

517
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,269
She'll get over it.

518
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,034
She hasn't gotten over my
making her return the stolen Milk Duds.

519
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,238
-You were right.
-I know.

520
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,435
Josey was the wrong face
to put on this.

521
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,312
But I'll tell you why
it should be front and center.

522
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,116
It's not the First Amendment.
It's not religious freedom.

523
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,432
It's not Church and State.
It's not abstract.

524
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,313
What is it?

525
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,276
It's the fourth-grader who gets
his ass kicked at recess...

526
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,678
... because he sat out the
voluntary prayer in homeroom.

527
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,596
It's another way of making kids
different from other kids.

528
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,080
And they' re required by law
to be there.

529
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,829
That's why you want it front and center.
The fourth-grader. That's the prize.

530
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,510
What did they do to you?

531
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,957
You're right about that part.

532
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,150
That part needs
to be talked about more.

533
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,959
-lt doe's.
-Okay.

534
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,397
What are you doing for dinner? Josh
and Sam and I are watching the game.

535
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,399
-I'm with the first family.
-Okay.

536
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,990
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't tell the president--

537
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,079
The president could honestly give a damn
what you guys are doing tomorrow.

538
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,516
Yeah. That's....

539
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,229
Mr. President?

540
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,079
-ls he here?
-Yes, sir.

541
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,195
Good.
Did we get an interpreter?

542
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,875
He speaks English.
He's a chemistry professor.

543
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,350
There was a while I wanted
to be a chemistry professor.

544
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,030
-What happened?
-I never actually studied chemistry.

545
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,716
These college chemistry departments
are really demanding that way.

546
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,673
Mr. President.

547
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,310
-Jhin Wei?
-Yes, sir.

548
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,196
-I'm Jed Bartlet. This is Leo McGarry.
-How do you do?

549
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,517
-Thank you for coming all this way.
-Yes, sir.

550
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,076
-Fellas, would you mind waiting outside?
-Certainly.

551
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,753
Would you care to sit down?

552
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,798
It's perfectly all right.

553
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,112
There are sandwiches.
If you get hungry...

554
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,796
...feel free to eat
as much as you please.

555
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,030
Yes, sir.

556
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,114
There are questions as to the veracity
of your claim to asylum.

557
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,077
Yes, sir.

558
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,990
How did you become a Christian?

559
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,114
I began attending a house church
with my wife in Fujian.

560
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,591
-Eventually, I was baptized.
-How do you practice?

561
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,471
We share Bibles.
We don't have enough.

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,150
We sing hymns.
We hear sermons.

563
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,359
We recite the Lord's Prayer.
We are charitable.

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,511
Who's the head of your church?

565
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,349
The head of our parish is
an 84-year-old man named Wen Ling.

566
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,516
He's been beaten
and imprisoned many times.

567
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,635
The head of our church is Jesus Christ.

568
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,197
Can you name any of Jesus' Apostles?

569
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,630
If you can't, that's okay. I usually
can't remember the names of my kids.

570
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,799
-Or for that matter--
-Peter, Andrew, John, Philip...

571
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,749
...Bartholomew, Thomas,
Matthew, Thaddaeus...

572
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,868
...Simon, Judas and James.

573
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,877
Mr. President...

574
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,076
...Christianity is not demonstrated
through a recitation of facts.

575
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,277
You're seeking evidence of faith.

576
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,918
A wholehearted acceptance
of God's promise of a better world.

577
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,189
" For we hold that man is justified
by faith alone, " is what St. Paul said.

578
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,079
Justified by faith alone.
Faith is the true....

579
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,439
I'm trying to--

580
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,995
Shibboleth.

581
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,839
Faith is the true shibboleth.

582
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,072
Yes, it is.

583
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,632
And you, sir, just said the magic word
in more ways than one.

584
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,870
Thank you.

585
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,710
-lt was a pleasure to meet you.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

586
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,198
We're trying to sell more 747s
to China, already a big customer.

587
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,756
We want China to crack down
on violators of American copyrights.

588
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,197
We're trying to get China to negotiate
a settlement with Tibet.

589
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,116
-Right.
-Right.

590
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,230
We don't have to grant asylum.

591
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,552
If you' re suggesting what I think you are,
you should know it's happened before.

592
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,753
-Where are they?
-An lNS detention facility in Otay Mesa.

593
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,958
They' re being guarded by lNS agents,
aided by members...

594
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,072
...of the 22nd Division
of the California National Guard.

595
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,391
-Not the Coast Guard?
-No.

596
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,519
Before....

597
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,032
When it happened before,
how did it work?

598
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,392
Well, you don't wanna piss off China,
and you don't want to send them back...

599
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,472
...so you gotta ask yourself,
how secure is the lNS detention facility?

600
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,038
Mrs. Landingham?

601
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,316
Yes, sir.

602
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,916
I need to talk to the governor
of California.

603
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,590
We're starting in five minutes. You can
move the press to the Rose Garden.

604
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,314
-Hey, T oscanini.
-I'm busy.

605
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,910
-You learning the song?
-I know the song.

606
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,798
"We gather together
to ask the Lord's blessing.

607
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,190
He chastens and hastens
his will to make known. "

608
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,112
-You know what it means?
-I don't have to.

609
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,274
I don't know what you're doing
for dinner tonight, but Josh--

610
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,949
It's about time you ask me.

611
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,310
I've been sitting here
for two weeks, turning down...

612
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,116
...very glamorous invitations
from people I like a lot more than you.

613
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,310
-Can't ask at the last minute--
-lf you can't--

614
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,114
-No! I can come!
-Good.

615
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,959
-Should I bring anything?
-Yeah. Do you know how to cook food?

616
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,510
We're in the Rose Garden
in five minutes.

617
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,553
C.J, this is Morton Horn.

618
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,036
He's from Jasper Farms,
here to take a turkey back.

619
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,555
-What do you mean?
-I've gotta take one back.

620
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,471
No, no! These turkeys are going
to a petting zoo in Delaware.

621
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,149
Well, one of them is.

622
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,436
Yeah, but I'm gonna send
both of them.

623
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,518
Jasper Farms donated one turkey,
the other--

624
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,029
But I'll take them both.

625
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,752
No, I gotta take a turkey back.

626
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,832
I'm gonna buy him from you.
Thirty bucks?

627
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,276
-These turkeys are $275.
-For a turkey?

628
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,199
-They' re specially raised.
-At the Waldorf?

629
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,396
-Ma'am--
-I'll pay it.

630
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,319
-It's been sold.
-Give them a different turkey.

631
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,751
-All the turkeys have been sold.
-C.J.--

632
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,196
It was my understanding that
one was to be pardoned...

633
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,158
...and the other one sent back.

634
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,835
I chose Eric because T roy
doe'sn't like to be touched...

635
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,077
...which we're not
going to execute him for.

636
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,356
-Ma'am, I have a job--
-Come with me, please.

637
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,077
-Ma'am?
-Grab the turkey and come with me.

638
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,634
All right.

639
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,750
Mrs. Landingham, can I look at a copy
of the Thanksgiving proclamation?

640
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,435
-Sir, why don't you use the intercom?
-Because--

641
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,872
-You don't know how to use it.
-I was standing at the door.

642
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,679
Maybe you can get
one of the fourth-graders...

643
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,270
...to come in and show you
how to use the intercom.

644
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,870
-Can I look at a copy?
-Sam is bringing it.

645
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,428
-Mr. President.
-What you got?

646
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,191
A winner, Mr. President.
The 1 985 Komin Yamada.

647
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,878
Made in Japan
from the best materials.

648
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,030
Lighter-weight blades.

649
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,237
Facilitates cutting
and reduces user fatigue.

650
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,398
-I once test-drove the Komin Yamada.
-And?

651
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,036
-Not wild about it. How--?
-Okay, Mr. President.

652
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,232
I say this with all possible respect,
but each of these knives cuts...

653
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,352
...you know, meat.
Why is it important--?

654
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,189
It's something we pass on.
Something with a history.

655
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,878
So we can say,
" My father gave this to me...

656
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,475
... his father gave it to him,
I'm giving it to you. "

657
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,958
Well, okay, but if that's true,
then why don't you already have one?

658
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,149
I do have one.

659
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,952
-Why do you need a new one?
-I'm giving mine away.

660
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,429
-T o who?
-Whom.

661
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,235
-T o whom?
-Funny you should ask.

662
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,596
Charlie, my father gave this to me,
and his father gave it to him...

663
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,076
...and now I'm giving it to you.

664
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,068
Take a look.

665
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,237
The fully tapered bolster allows for
sharpening the entire edge of the blade.

666
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,157
It says, "P.R. "

667
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,710
I thought I knew them all,
but I don't recognize it.

668
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,518
These were made for my family by a
Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.

669
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,389
Mr. President?

670
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,350
I'm proud of you, Charlie.

671
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,194
Thank you, sir.

672
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,118
Five minutes in the Rose Garden.

673
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,596
-Mr. President?
-Yes.

674
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,519
-Hi.
-Hi.

675
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,428
-Sorry to ask you this, but--
-Not too late to stop yourself.

676
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,190
-I need you to pardon a turkey.
-I already pardoned one.

677
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,078
-Another one.
-Didn't I do it right?

678
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,516
You did great, but I need you
to pardon another.

679
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,310
Won't I get a reputation
for being soft on turkeys?

680
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,068
Sir, can you get this over with?

681
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,709
No, I'm not gonna get this--
What the hell's going on?

682
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,275
They sent me two turkeys.

683
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,109
The more photo-friendly one
gets a presidential pardon...

684
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,591
...and a full life at a children's zoo.
The runner-up gets eaten.

685
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,470
If the Oscars were like that,
I'd watch.

686
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,518
-Buy the second turkey.
-It's already sold.

687
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,917
-There's not much I can do.
-Pardon the turkey.

688
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,878
-The turkey hasn't committed a crime.
-Sir--

689
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,590
C.J., I have, really,
no judicial jurisdiction over birds.

690
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,078
I know that, and you know that,
but Morton Horn doe'sn't know that.

691
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,475
He's the high school kid
from the turkey place.

692
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,592
And he doe'sn't
know I can't pardon his turkey?

693
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,155
That's what I'm betting.

694
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,068
If we don't completely overhaul
public education in this country--

695
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,834
-Yes, but this is not the best time to--
-Where is he?

696
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,553
Right out here.

697
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,877
Morton, this is President Bartlet.

698
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,679
-Hey, Morton.
-Wow!

699
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,077
-Well said. Is that the turkey?
-Yes.

700
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,189
-You're pardoned.
-Sir?

701
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,033
-What do you want?
-You know....

702
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,079
By the power vested in me by the
Constitution of the United States...

703
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,075
-... I hereby pardon you.
-Okay.

704
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,037
-No, it's not okay.
-Sir?

705
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,873
Morton, I can't pardon a turkey.

706
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,510
If you think I can pardon a turkey,
then go back to your school...

707
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,429
...and insist to be better prepared
to go out in the world.

708
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,996
You can't pardon a turkey?

709
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,270
No. I'll tell you what I can do.

710
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,075
I'm drafting this turkey
into military service.

711
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,156
In the meantime,
somebody will draft a check...

712
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,439
...with my signature on it so the folks
can buy themselves a Butterball.

713
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,597
Okay.

714
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,078
Take T roy back to his pen and
remember to support his hindquarters.

715
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,758
-What's wrong--?
-The turkey's hindquarters.

716
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,752
-I'm still waiting for the thing.
-Here.

717
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,069
Let's go in.

718
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,833
-Sir?
-Give me two minutes.

719
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,152
I'm going to step out there
and begin the singing and lute playing.

720
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,629
Whatever.

721
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,196
I assume you've heard.

722
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,638
By the way, the Latin word
for yam is Dioscorea.

723
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,797
You've heard?

724
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,550
-About the Chinese refugees?
-They escaped.

725
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,149
I know. Can you believe it?

726
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,475
No, neither one of us
can believe it, sir.

727
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,310
That detention center was being guarded
by the California National Guard.

728
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,478
Now what doe's it say
about our Reserve Army?

729
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,319
That 83 men, women and children...

730
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,037
...who haven't eaten in two months,
staged a prison break?

731
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,752
Let me read this.

732
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,159
" Over three and a half centuries ago,
strengthened by faith...

733
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,038
...and bound by a common desire
for liberty...

734
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,673
...a small band of Pilgrims
sought out a place in the New World...

735
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,117
...where they could worship
according to their own beliefs.

736
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,676
Therefore, l, Josiah Bartlet,
President of the United States...

737
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,270
... by virtue of the authority
and laws vested in me...

738
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,793
...do hereby proclaim this to be
a National Day of Thanksgiving. "

739
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,037
I'll see you out there, sir.

740
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,034
You asked the governor
to stand down the 22nd Division.

741
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,590
And call in the Red Cross.

742
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,799
We didn't do anything illegal.

743
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,271
You're not involved
in any massive criminal conspiracy.

744
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,951
I wasn't letting them go,
and we needed to help China save face.

745
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,154
They can tell their people that the mighty
American military was overpowered by--

746
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,960
So the guy passed the test, huh?

747
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,952
You think I would have sent him back
if he failed catechism?

748
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,274
Let me tell you something.

749
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,199
We can be the world's policeman.

750
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,035
We can be the world's bank,
the world's factory, the world's farm.

751
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,149
What doe's it mean
if we're not also...?

752
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
They made it to the New World, Josh.

753
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,150
You know what I get to do now?

754
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,919
I get to proclaim
a National Day of Thanksgiving.

755
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,516
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
the president of the United States.

756
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,076
This is a great job.
