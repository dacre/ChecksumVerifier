00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,028
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,476
My father sees danger,
like, behind curtains.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,917
Zoey, do me a favor.
Walk on the other side of me.

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:16,193
Josh, sometimes I wonder if I listened
to you two years ago...

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,757
...would I be president now?
You ever wonder that?

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,678
No, sir, I know it for sure.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,713
Gun!

8
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:26,118
Get down!

9
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,439
-Get in the car!
-Move!

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,882
--at this time.
No idea or clear indication....

11
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:57,843
-ls Zoey secure? Get her again.
-She wasn't hit, sir--

12
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,393
-Get her on the radio.
-Sir, she can't talk right now.

13
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:03,233
-Why can't she talk?
-She's vomiting in the car.

14
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,164
-lt happens, sir.
-Why is she vomiting?

15
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,596
-She might have gotten elbowed--
-ls Gina with her?

16
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,756
-Gina put her in the car.
-She's not with her.

17
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,720
She's got two other agents in the car.
They're gonna have her...

18
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,236
...back in the White House--
-Why isn't Gina in the car?

19
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:22,443
Gina put Zoey in the car, stayed behind
for the lD agent. Mr. President, please.

20
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:29,000
-ls anybody dead back there?
-We don't know. We don't think so.

21
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,244
-What happened to your hand?
-I got hit.

22
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:34,326
Oh, God. Coop, turn around.
We gotta go to the hospital.

23
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,684
-We've gotta get you--
-The hospital. Let's go!

24
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,326
I have to put you inside the White House.
This isn't something we discuss.

25
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,721
This is-- My daughter is throwing up
on the floor in the car behind us.

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,160
You're losing blood by the liter, not to
mention how many broken bones...

27
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:52,247
...in your hand, but let's make
sure I'm tucked in bed before we--

28
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,725
Mr. President?

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,760
GW, move, move, move!

30
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,727
She's stable. Get me some 4-by-4s.

31
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,851
-I'm really fine.
-Scalp laceration, secondary to fall.

32
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,445
-I hit my head on the ground.
-No LOC.

33
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,131
Somebody put me down.

34
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:19,970
-Are you C.J. Cregg?
-Yeah.

35
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:23,209
-Can you tell me what day it is?
-It's still Monday.

36
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,562
C.J., you're more shaken up
than anything else.

37
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,485
Won't need stitches, but you
should find a place to lie down.

38
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,004
-ls the president dead?
-I wouldn't know anything about that.

39
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:35,888
-Over there, sir. Behind the ambulance.
-You all right, ma'am?

40
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,733
Please. Behind!

41
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,482
-You all right?
-What?

42
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:44,287
-You all right?
-Where's the president?

43
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:48,566
On his way back to the White House,
so is Zoey. They just put Leo in a car.

44
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:51,408
-Are you all right?
-Somebody put me down.

45
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,971
-Gina!
-I can't talk right now. Gina T oscano.

46
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,687
-T ommy Cho.
-You're the lD agent.

47
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:59,490
Two shooters in that window. Got them
from the roof, but there was a signal.

48
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:02,893
-There was somebody on the ground?
-White male. 20, 25, maybe 5' 1 0".

49
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,767
-What else?
-Wearing a baseball cap.

50
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,254
What kind of cap?

51
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,973
-Maybe it got knocked off in the crowd.
-What kind of cap?

52
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,688
I don't know.

53
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,609
Fix a perimeter. Close the airport.
Shut them down.

54
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:16,728
I want the Harbor Patrol
and the Coast Guard.

55
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:18,531
Stevie! Paul!

56
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,612
Josh? Josh?

57
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:23,853
-Hey, Charlie.
-Are you okay?

58
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:26,293
-Yeah. You seen Josh?
-He got in the car with Leo.

59
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,729
No, he didn't. Shannahan got in
with Leo. Josh didn't get in the car.

60
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:33,811
-Can we get some help?
-Yeah. Stay right there.

61
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,688
Josh, didn't you hear me
shouting for you?

62
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,373
I didn't know where the hell you....

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,738
I need a.... I need a doctor! I need help!

64
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:37,813
Dr. Partridge, you 're wanted....

65
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:43,857
-Hi.
-Hey. Your best friend's back.

66
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:49,703
Thank you for that. Cynthia. Hi.
You can follow me.

67
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:54,145
She's been in twice a week for three
weeks. She can't feel the baby kick.

68
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:57,782
I should say, "Wait till eight months,
the kid will be doing the Macarena.

69
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,777
In the meantime,
this is an emergency room. "

70
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,345
-Did you really say that?
-No. I'm saying I should have said that.

71
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,699
Emergency room.

72
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,699
-Station one.
-We're coming in.

73
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,944
-I copy that. Is this a drill?
-No!

74
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:19,857
The thing is, I have a few patients.
A couple of kids with alcohol poisoning...

75
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:23,259
...and we're expecting more.
So if this is a drill, I'd just as soon....

76
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,342
Trauma 1! Trauma 1, blue, blue!
Trauma 1, blue.

77
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,302
Go.

78
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:35,943
-You got priorities?
-No priorities.

79
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,186
Put them in a van.
They're going to Memorial.

80
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:42,224
Okay, people. I need you to follow this
gentleman to the van that's waiting.

81
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,900
I need the south door clear. There are
two back doors and a loading dock.

82
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:49,626
Put two units on the scaffolding
and get some light out there.

83
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,666
-Give me ultrasound and a crash cart.
-Eagle's two minutes away.

84
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,701
Mr. Vice President, could you
hold the shirt up?

85
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:00,391
Now, one of my roommates
at SMU was Drew Harper.

86
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,390
-Anybody know that name?
-' 72?

87
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,710
' 72 Olympics in Munich. I played against
him in a pickup game...

88
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,348
...and I thought I'd stuff him
with an overhead slam.

89
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,386
He sent that ball back at me
like I talked about his sister.

90
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:15,391
Coach, I wanna congratulate you
and your team and the NCAA...

91
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:18,983
...on a great season. You got four
starters returning, so I'm confident--

92
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:22,664
Excuse me. Everyone stay where you are.

93
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:26,312
Mr. Vice President,
would you come with us, please?

94
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,509
-Mrs. Bartlet.
-ls he conscious?

95
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,390
He's conscious and they're moving him
to pre-op. Hit in the side, entry and exit.

96
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,233
-What about Zoey?
-Got her in the car.

97
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:40,790
She's on her way to GW.

98
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,674
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

99
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:48,349
He's been shot in the abdomen.
Visible entry and exit wound.

100
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:51,316
BP, 1 34/78. Pulse, 1 08.

101
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:52,950
-What's his pulse ox?
-98.

102
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:55,956
Mr. President, I'm Dr. Keller.
I'm the trauma surgeon on duty.

103
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:58,956
The exit wound is a good indication.
We like your vital signs.

104
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,273
If I don't speak to my daughter
in five minutes...

105
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,036
...I'm gonna attack someone.
-On her way.

106
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,871
He's got about seven broken bones
in his hand, by the way...

107
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,712
...if somebody wants to give him
an aspirin or something.

108
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,347
Okay, sir. We're just gonna
get you stabilized.

109
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,795
I want you to wait as long as you can
before you give me the anesthesia.

110
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:18,827
-I need to speak to Leo McGarry.
-He's on his way as well.

111
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:22,389
I need to ask you some questions, sir.
Do you have any medical conditions?

112
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,194
Well, I've been shot.

113
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,234
-Good evening, Mrs. Landingham.
-Evening, Margaret.

114
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,671
-The president's not back yet?
-I imagine he's schmoozing the rope line.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,275
You know, he says he's coming straight
back, but he can't resist a rope line.

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,031
Never has. He'll complain,
but he just can't resist it.

117
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:43,312
-I remember a time about 1 0 years ago--
-Mrs. Landingham.

118
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,673
-More, maybe 1 2--
-Mrs. Landingham.

119
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:52,281
Good evening. We are getting reports
that multiple gunshots were fired...

120
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:57,597
...at President Bartlet as he was leaving
a public event in Rosslyn, Virginia.

121
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:02,882
The shots were fired approximately seven
minutes ago from an office building....

122
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,522
-Dad?
-I ' m okay.

123
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:05,911
-Daddy?
-Didn't hit anything.

124
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,194
They're just gonna look around
and make sure.

125
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:09,757
-Are you in pain?
-No.

126
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,879
-Are you lying?
-Yeah. I want these guys...

127
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,603
...to tell reporters
that I was brave and joking around.

128
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,233
-You are brave. You were good tonight.
-Honey, I'm fine.

129
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,799
-I'm just so happy to see you.
-Mom's on her way.

130
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,717
-Mom's gonna be pretty pissed.
-Yeah.

131
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,041
-How you doing, kid?
-I'm fine.

132
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,874
She booted all over the back of her car.
You know they'll bill me for that.

133
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,195
-Yeah.
-Honey, do me a favor, will you?

134
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:37,636
Yeah. I'll step outside.
I'll go wait for Mom.

135
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,804
T ell her not to frighten the doctors.
See you in a couple hours.

136
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,798
-I love you.
-I love you too, hon.

137
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,158
-Anybody killed back there?
-The two shooters.

138
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:48,755
-Got them through the window.
-Anybody in the crowd?

139
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,718
Some injuries.
They're coming right now.

140
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,681
-What about our people?
-C.J. hit her head on the ground...

141
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,917
...but other than that....
-Here's the 16.

142
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,879
-Get the Cabinet together.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:02,246
And the Security Council. T ell Jerome to
suspend trading on the stock exchange.

144
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:05,884
-Do we know who the shooters were?
-No.

145
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,722
I'm gonna be under anesthesia
for a couple hours.

146
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,966
-lt'll be fine.
-You know what I'm talking about?

147
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,445
-I'll talk to Abbey.
-Sir, it's time.

148
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,685
Hey, come here.

149
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,122
It's okay.

150
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,760
I'll see you in a few hours,
Mr. President.

151
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,960
Okay, Zoey, I'll find out.

152
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,608
-You all right?
-Yeah. And Dad's making jokes.

153
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,921
Good ones? Okay.

154
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,484
-Abbey.
-Hi.

155
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,841
-This is Dr. Keller.
-Yes. We spoke in the car.

156
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,247
-Hello.
-What's his PO-2?

157
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,125
-It's 100.
-Gonna do a laparoscopy?

158
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,566
Yeah. We wanna make sure
the peritoneum's intact.

159
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,490
-Who's the anesthesiologist?
-Dr. Lee.

160
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:53,004
-Right. You'll be okay for a minute?
-Yeah.

161
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,972
-Dr. Lee?
-Dr. Bartlet.

162
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,449
I hope they told you that
it's looking very good.

163
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:08,522
There are 14 people in the world who
know this, including the vice president...

164
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,806
...the chief of staff, and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

165
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,164
You are going to be the 15th.

166
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,447
Seven years ago,
my husband was diagnosed...

167
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:20,692
...with a relapsing,
remitting course of MS.

168
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:25,452
When all this is over,
tell the press, don't tell the press.

169
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,329
It's entirely up to you.

170
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,771
-You all right?
-Yeah.

171
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:44,815
-Was there someone on the ground?
-There was a signal.

172
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,658
-I couldn't give a description.
-They close the airports?

173
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,896
And Union Station. We've got
300 field agents working Rosslyn...

174
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:53,207
...but I can't tell them
what they're looking for.

175
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,974
-You got the girl in the car, Gina.
-It's right in front of my face.

176
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,772
Look at me. I'll--

177
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,730
Gunshot wound! No exit!

178
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:03,777
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Pulse ox, 92 on 15 liters.

179
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,408
-It's Josh!
-I've got the HemoCue.

180
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,292
-Trauma panel--
-What happened?

181
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,774
-I don't know. He was behind us.
-Single gunshot wound.

182
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,654
-Entry, left fifth intercostal space.
-Josh, I'm here.

183
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,056
--at this meeting.
I shouldn't be at this meeting.

184
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,616
-Trauma 1's ready.
-Get a needle. Chest tube tray.

185
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,499
-Senator....
-Tell me what's happening.

186
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,100
-I don't have time.
-Shouldn't be at this meeting.

187
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,453
-Pulse ox, 88.
-I need to get to New Hampshire.

188
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,734
You went to New Hampshire.
We both did. You came and got me.

189
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,209
On my count. One. Two. Three.

190
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,891
Josh, a bullet collapsed your lung.
I'm putting in a tube to expand it.

191
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,780
-Bradying down.
-Okay, tube him now.

192
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:41,898
-8-0 ET tube.
-Social Security....

193
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,815
-Senator.
-Social Security is the black hole--

194
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,171
-Senator.
-Social--

195
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:47,656
-Senator.
-Social Security--

196
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:49,819
-Yes.
-Social Security is the black hole...

197
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:51,456
...of national politics.
-Yes.

198
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,416
Josh was cutting me off because
he knew I was gonna say that.

199
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,452
-Because I have said it, what...?
-Few hundred times.

200
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:02,975
And I would just as soon not
get lost in it 13 weeks before...

201
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,934
...the New Hampshire primary. It is the
third rail. You step on it and you die.

202
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:11,581
Of the 537 federal elected officials,
there are 30 who've put their names...

203
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,062
...on Social Security reform legislation.
You're one of them. Why not say so?

204
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,303
-He will say so, just not now.
-Mark, at $400 billion...

205
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:21,384
...Social Security represents
one-fourth of the federal budget...

206
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,775
...and it's gonna be bankrupt
in exactly 17 years.

207
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:26,704
Right around the time
you're gonna check your mailbox.

208
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:30,984
Half the elderly population will be living
in poverty. This qualifies as a priority.

209
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,464
Running for president of the United
States, not putting Social Security...

210
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:38,218
...front and center is like running for
president of Disney by saying...

211
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,783
...you're gonna fix the rides at Epcot.
-we're gonna get to Social Security.

212
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,866
It's a long campaign.
For now, we focus on the tax cuts.

213
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:48,897
-It's what magicians call misdirection.
-It's what the rest of us call bull shi...

214
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,547
Knock it off.

215
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:51,897
I have a vote.

216
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:55,900
The rest of you should stay here
and work on the ethanol tax credit.

217
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,863
Josh, come with me, would you?

218
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,745
You don't seem to be having
a very good time lately.

219
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,941
I don't think the point of this
is for me to--

220
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,791
You've been pissed off
in every meeting for a month.

221
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,181
Senator, you're the favorite to be
the Democratic nominee for president.

222
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,783
You have $58 million in a war chest
with no end in sight, and....

223
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,509
I don't know what we're for.

224
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,827
I don't know what we're for
or what we're against...

225
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:27,104
...except we seem to be for winning
and against somebody else winning.

226
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,710
-It's a start.
-Senator--

227
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:31,306
We'll run a good campaign.
You'll be very proud of it.

228
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,186
And when we get to the White House,
you'll play a big role.

229
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:38,910
In the meantime, cheer up and
get off my ass about Social Security.

230
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,507
I've gotta vote.

231
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:52,430
-Josh.
-Mr. Secretary.

232
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,864
I hope you don't mind
I didn't make an appointment.

233
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:57,623
-I'm trying to fly under the radar.
-No, of course not...

234
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,751
...but the senator just went down
for a vote.

235
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:04,112
The annual vote to override the veto
on shipping nuclear waste to Nevada.

236
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:05,669
-Yeah.
-lt won't pass.

237
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,474
-No kidding.
-Actually, I came to see you.

238
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,749
-Really?
-Yeah.

239
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,745
-What can I do for you?
-You mind if we take a walk?

240
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,673
-Sure.
-I heard your dad was in...

241
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,107
...the hospital again.
-Yeah, they think they got it all this time.

242
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,434
-ls he taking it easy?
-No. He doe's the opposite.

243
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,673
Seven every morning, comes home
at 8 every night.

244
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:27,915
On the weekends, he cleans the gutters
and yells at the squirrels.

245
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:31,706
-Why doe's he yell at the squirrels?
-They eat out of the bird feeder.

246
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:34,994
-You know, they make a thing now--
-He prefers to admonish them.

247
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,270
Listen, I need to get back
to this meeting.

248
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:41,198
Josh, I'd like you to come to
Nashua, New Hampshire Thursday...

249
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,356
...and hear Jed Bartlet speak.

250
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,148
-I work for Senator Hoynes.
-Yeah.

251
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,986
-Mr. Secretary--
-I'm not in the Cabinet anymore. Leo.

252
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,714
-Hoynes has the nomination sewn up.
-Yeah.

253
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,473
And if Bartlet's looking to be
treasury secretary...

254
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,478
...or a slot at the convention,
this really isn't--

255
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,434
-Come to Nashua Thursday night.
-Why?

256
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,313
Because that's what sons do for old
friends of their fathers. I'll see you then.

257
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
-Mr. Secretary--
-Leo.

258
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:13,670
Leo, the Democrats aren't gonna
nominate another liberal, academic...

259
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,031
...former governor from New England.

260
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,789
I mean, we're dumb,
but we're not that dumb.

261
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,274
I think we're exactly that dumb.

262
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:40,671
Yeah. Janet, I need you to set up
some train tickets for me.

263
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:45,522
I think tomorrow at some point....

264
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,676
All in, showroom floor
to your garage, $18 million.

265
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:02,798
-18 million is a cheap price, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

266
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:06,481
What you're happy about isn't the price.
It's the structure of the deal.

267
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:11,238
-Well, how do you figure that?
-Sam's gonna tell you about it. Sam.

268
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,084
-Structure versus cost.
-Yeah.

269
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,961
What Jack means is that if you were
getting the tankers for...

270
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,522
...$1.85 in trading stamps,
it'd still be a bad deal...

271
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,763
...if we didn't limit your liability.
-And did you?

272
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,323
We did, by creating a separate
corporation for each one of them...

273
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,075
...mortgage the boats top to bottom.
-Ships.

274
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,836
-I'm sorry?
-Oil tankers aren't boats. they're ships.

275
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:36,880
You want me to buy the boats, you're
not asking me to be first mate, right?

276
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,241
No.

277
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,245
You wanna finance the tankers 100%
so that if litigation doe's penetrate...

278
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,089
...the liability shield we've set up,
there are no assets...

279
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,679
...at the end of the line, just debt.
you're judgment-proof.

280
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,922
Let me run and get the tax figures
while David and Rita talk about...

281
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,445
...IMO regulations.

282
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,199
Sam, there's a guy waiting in your office
who said he's a friend of yours.

283
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,766
-What's his name?
-Josh Lyman.

284
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,763
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

285
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,005
How you doing?

286
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:14,247
-Hey, you look fit.
-You made partner?

287
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,002
Next month. Listen, I'm hungry. You
wanna go get a hot dog or something?

288
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,204
-It's 9:30 in the morning.
-Yeah, they'll be fresh. Come on.

289
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,845
Okay.

290
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,765
I was gonna call before I came,
but the strangest thing happened.

291
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,526
-What?
-I forgot the name of your firm.

292
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,405
-Gage Whitney?
-Yeah.

293
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,485
-You couldn't remember Gage Whitney.
-I know.

294
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,684
-Second biggest law firm in New York.
-I know.

295
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,009
The Shearson deal, Transcom....

296
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:42,414
I really do know Gage Whitney. I'm
saying I'm just having a brain problem.

297
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,292
What are you doing in town?

298
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,726
-I'm on my way to Nashua.
-What's in Nashua?

299
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,773
Waste of time.
Listen, you know why I'm here?

300
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:53,244
You want me to quit my job
and come work for Hoynes?

301
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:55,094
-He's gonna win.
-Why doe's he need me?

302
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:58,811
A better campaign.
Come do some speechwriting.

303
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,333
Lisa and I are getting married
in September.

304
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,728
Yeah.

305
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,571
Okay.

306
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:12,736
Listen, I gotta go.
I should let you....

307
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:15,890
-I gotta get back to this thing.
-It's good seeing you again.

308
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,288
It's good seeing you too.
I miss you.

309
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:23,047
Congratulations on the partnership.

310
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:24,568
Josh.

311
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,773
Hoynes.

312
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,850
He's not the real thing, is he?

313
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,572
-The thing you gotta know about--
-It's okay.

314
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,498
No, I'm saying....

315
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,849
Josh.

316
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,772
What are you doing?

317
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,135
I don't know.

318
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,020
-What are you doing?
-Protecting oil companies from litigation.

319
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,656
They're our client.

320
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,859
They don't lose legal protection
because they make a lot of money.

321
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:02,578
I can't believe no one ever wrote
a folk song about that.

322
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,739
If I see the real thing in Nashua,
should I tell you about it?

323
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,251
-You won't have to.
-Why?

324
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:17,821
-You've got a pretty bad poker face.
-Okay.

325
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,495
-Take it easy.
-Okay.

326
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,344
-l'm sorry.
-That's okay.

327
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:29,976
I'm sorry. I was just....

328
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:33,142
George Washington emergency.
We're not giving any information.

329
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:34,744
-Dr. Bartlet.
-Yes.

330
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,178
The president's going to be fine.

331
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:39,814
You can see him in the recovery room
in about two hours.

332
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:42,857
Thank you. No organ damage?

333
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,864
No, ma'am.
And the blood loss was minimal.

334
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,580
Dr. Keller was able to visualize
the entire abdomen...

335
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:52,541
...and he's secure with the diagnostic
sensitivity of the laparoscopy.

336
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,339
What about Josh?

337
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,346
The bullet lacerated
his pulmonary artery.

338
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,739
-Can they try a Gore-T ex graft?
-No. they're gonna have to stay in...

339
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:04,705
...and try to repair the artery primarily.
-Thank you.

340
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:09,665
The president's going to be fine.

341
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,819
The bullet seems to have gone
out of its way not to hit anything.

342
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:17,027
Now, here's what's happening
with Josh. The situation....

343
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,787
-Thank you.
-What do you know?

344
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,099
He'll be out of surgery in about two
hours. Fitzwallace is on a plane?

345
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,267
He was on his way to Manila.
He'll be back in about four hours.

346
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:26,776
-We got him by phone?
-Yeah.

347
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,980
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Mr. McGarry.

348
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,500
-Where's the national security advisor?
-On her way.

349
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,258
-So is the vice president.
-Good evening, everybody.

350
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,702
Could you have someone send over
some clothes? I look like an idiot.

351
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,145
-Nancy, you've seen the KH-10 pictures?
-Yeah.

352
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,506
-Know what they mean?
-I wouldn't go that far.

353
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,823
-Good evening, Mr. Vice President.
-Good evening, Nancy, Leo.

354
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,306
-Jack.
-Ten-hut.

355
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,827
No, as you were. It's okay.

356
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,506
Bobby, can you report
on domestic activity?

357
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:02,310
Yes, sir. There's not much. Air traffic
control down for 22 minutes at Logan.

358
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:05,505
Citibank computers were off-line
for a little more than an hour...

359
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:08,590
...and the lights went out for
seven minutes at the Delta Center.

360
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:12,070
Somebody tell me. These shooters
didn't have a wallet, driver's license?

361
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,823
They didn't have anything on them.
They knew we were gonna get them.

362
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:19,184
If this signal guy isn't in custody
in one hour, I'm gonna federalize...

363
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,833
...the Virginia National Guard.

364
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,708
It's worth mentioning that we do not
know the whereabouts of a half-dozen...

365
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:28,470
...cell leaders, including Bin Laden,
but that's not my concern right now.

366
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,791
-What is your concern?
-Can we look at the KH-10's?

367
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,110
I've seen them.
I'm not worried about it.

368
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:36,109
Leo, these images show
a sudden buildup of frontline...

369
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,068
...Republican Guard units along
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

370
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,107
It's not sudden.
They do it every few months.

371
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:42,794
And they're moving south.

372
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:46,352
Not 13 hours ago,
they shot down an F-117 in the no-fly.

373
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:50,306
The rescue mission invaded their airspace
with armed M-50 Pave Hawks...

374
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,589
...and my recommendation would be
that the president order Fitzwallace...

375
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,869
...to put the 32nd Tactical on
ready alert and take us to DEFCON 4.

376
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,949
The president is under
general anesthesia right now.

377
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,996
If he weren't, l'm sure he'd be
comforted by knowing that RDF...

378
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,507
...can put Marines
on the ground in 36 hours.

379
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:08,517
-We may not have 36 hours.
-lraqi Republican Guard...

380
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:10,789
...can't find their car keys
in 36 hours.

381
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:13,547
Look at the pictures.
I think they found them.

382
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:33,840
Nancy, we're gonna follow Leo
for the moment.

383
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,753
Jack, what's the best way
to get a message to lraq?

384
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,039
-King of Jordan.
-Okay.

385
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,473
Leo, what do you want
the message to be?

386
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:50,078
Don't mess with us tonight.

387
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:04,472
Excuse me. We can't make you
very comfortable here...

388
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:09,235
...and Josh's procedure is likely
to take 12 to 14 hours. So--

389
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:13,434
I'm sorry. They told me I should
come back here. I'm sorry.

390
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:21,882
-ls there word on the president?
-The president's gonna be fine.

391
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:26,837
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
That's the best news I've ever heard.

392
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:30,401
I got here as fast as I could.
I had a hard time getting in.

393
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,837
I had to find an agent who knew me,
I was shaking...

394
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:37,282
...it was just-- I didn't know anything.
-Donna.

395
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,599
Josh was hit.

396
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,286
Hit with what?

397
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,964
He was shot. In the chest.

398
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,756
He's in surgery right now.

399
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:58,726
I don't understand.

400
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,568
I don't understand. Is--?

401
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,845
Is it serious?

402
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,083
Yes, it's critical.

403
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:12,329
The bullet collapsed his lung
and damaged a major artery.

404
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,723
I was just saying we can't
make you very comfortable here...

405
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,080
...and the procedure's likely
to take 12 to 14 hours.

406
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,248
We won't know anything until morning.
I'm sure there are things...

407
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,091
...you're supposed to be attending
to right now, so if you like...

408
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:33,842
...we can stay in touch with you at your
homes and offices throughout the night.

409
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:52,005
Leo's meeting with the leadership soon.
When he's done, I'll talk to the press.

410
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:57,050
I'm gonna go back to the residence and
pick up some things for the president.

411
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,974
C.J., when can we talk
to the medical team?

412
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:11,725
Benjamin Keller, the chief surgeon,
and Admiral Jarvis...

413
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:18,371
...the president's personal physician,
will be available in a few hours.

414
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:22,572
-Was the 25th Amendment discussed?
-No.

415
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,448
-What? Why not?
-l'm sorry?

416
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,812
Why hasn't the 25th Amendment
been discussed?

417
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:30,491
Danny, as I said before, the president's
wounds are relatively superficial.

418
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,973
He'll be out of surgery before morning
and he's expected to make a full...

419
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,614
...and speedy recovery.

420
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:37,973
-Anything on the shooters' identity?
-l'm sorry?

421
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:40,606
-Anything on the identity of the shooters?
-Not yet.

422
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,134
AP is reporting that two bodies
were brought out of the building.

423
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,215
-I don't have anything for you on that.
-They're also reporting...

424
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:51,287
...a massive manhunt underway for a
possible third accomplice on the ground.

425
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:54,046
I don't have anything for you
on that either.

426
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:57,968
C.J.! Can you tell us why the AP
knows more than you do?

427
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,979
I don't believe that,
I just believe they're willing...

428
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,333
...to tell you more than I am.

429
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,328
-One more question. Arthur.
-ln previous administrations...

430
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,896
...the president entered and exited
public buildings under a tent or canopy...

431
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,971
...the Secret Service wanting to limit
his visibility in open air.

432
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,894
Can you talk about why this precaution
isn't taken for President Bartlet?

433
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,779
-Or at least why it wasn't tonight.
-Arthur, it's policy...

434
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,216
...not to comment
on protection procedures.

435
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,497
If you won't answer
straightforward questions...

436
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,932
...is there anything you can tell us?

437
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:32,216
-I'm sorry?
-ls there anything you can tell us?

438
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:38,776
I'll be back for a briefing in an hour and
a half. Hopefully we'll know more then.

439
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,816
-Cabinet's meeting in five minutes.
-What did that mean:

440
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,542
-"You can't seem to give us answers"?
-You scratched your neck.

441
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:45,892
-What?
-The side of your neck.

442
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:49,255
I lost my necklace.
It must've come off when....

443
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,898
-When what?
-Somebody pushed me down.

444
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,780
-lt must've come off then.
-C.J.

445
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,661
I'm sorry. I'd like to not be
a reporter for a few minutes...

446
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:58,821
...but you gotta answer my question.
-What was it?

447
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:00,855
The president's under anesthesia...

448
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:04,334
...he'll be on a morphine drip in post-op.
Without the 25th, who's in charge?

449
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,617
The vice president, secretary of
state, national security advisor...

450
00:27:07,905 --> 00:27:10,373
...secretary of defense,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs--

451
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,496
You just named six people.
Who's in charge?

452
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:15,986
The Canadians. You understand
I'm talking about the hockey team.

453
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:19,535
-Look--
-Just give me a little time.

454
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:27,822
Fitzwallace agrees with me, Nancy.
Any upgrade in our DEFCON posture...

455
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,546
...and the world's gonna
wake up in the middle of the night.

456
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:33,863
The world's awake, Leo.
Look at the TV. Look out the window.

457
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:37,144
There was more than one shooter.
We think they had a guy on the ground.

458
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:40,386
If we think they had one,
they may have had more than one.

459
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,187
Somebody got them
into that office.

460
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:45,744
This wasn't a lonely guy who lived
with his cats. There was a plan.

461
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:49,544
And one of the things we have to assume
is that we are under attack right now.

462
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:52,548
In which case, the vice president
should order the 32nd Tactical...

463
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,547
...on ready alert
and take us to DEFCON 4.

464
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,549
-Council's office isn't sure he can.
-Why not?

465
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,982
-He never signed the letter.
-What letter?

466
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,824
If the president's gonna be
under a general anesthetic--

467
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,548
He's gotta sign a letter
giving the vice president power?

468
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,788
The Constitution doe'sn't give it to him
unless the president's dead.

469
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,827
He's bleeding and has to draft a memo?

470
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,629
-Yeah.
-I'm getting questions...

471
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:16,180
...from Danny Concanon on it.
-lt gets more complicated...

472
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:19,748
...if you'd read Section 202
of the National Security Act of 1947.

473
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:23,343
-Let's assume I haven't.
-lt says that the secretary of defense...

474
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:27,181
...will be principal assistant to the
president on matters of national security.

475
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:31,825
-What doe's " principal assistant" mean?
-lt doe'sn't specify.

476
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:35,747
It wouldn't, because this is an area of
federal law where you'd want ambiguity.

477
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:37,062
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

478
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:41,461
-I'm gonna go back to the hospital.
-I'll be there in a little bit.

479
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:46,664
Try and hold Danny off till the
council's office tells us where we are.

480
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:48,352
-Yeah. Listen--
-Scratched your neck.

481
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:49,543
-What?
-Your neck.

482
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,984
That's where my necklace....
They're asking me about...

483
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,624
...the canopy the Secret Service used
to use for outdoor entrances and exits.

484
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:57,826
-Who asked you?
-lt was Arthur Leeds...

485
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:01,346
...and then a couple
of others stopped me.

486
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:03,706
Okay.

487
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:06,389
We don't comment on
protection procedures...

488
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,791
...so I don't think we'll have
to answer that.

489
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,152
-Yeah.
-Okay.

490
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:15,593
-See you at the hospital.
-Yeah.

491
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:21,347
I need Section 202 of the National
Securities Act of 1947.

492
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,593
Hey, Ginger.
I didn't know you were here.

493
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:25,788
I just got here.

494
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:27,675
I just....

495
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,877
I turned on the TV....

496
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,268
It's okay.

497
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,909
Come here.

498
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:40,512
It's all right. It's okay.

499
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,315
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:48,478
-You all right?
-Yeah.

501
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,913
-Ready to go to work?
-Yeah.

502
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,553
-You want another one of those?
-What?

503
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,879
I didn't say anything.

504
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,595
-You want another one of those?
-Yeah.

505
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,194
I gotta tell you, I didn't even
know Bartlet was running.

506
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,592
Yeah, we keep that secret pretty good.

507
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,802
He's speaking at the VFW Hall tonight.
You should come.

508
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,872
I'm not very political.

509
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,913
There'll be free chicken.

510
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,756
You've been a....
What'd you call it?

511
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,198
-Professional political operative.
-You've been one your whole life?

512
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:31,883
Well, there was a while there
I was in elementary school.

513
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,280
You any good at it?

514
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:42,443
I'm very good at it.

515
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,074
What's your record?

516
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,999
-My record?
-How many elections have you won?

517
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:53,761
Altogether?

518
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:59,281
Including city council,
two congressional races, Senate race...

519
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:03,035
...gubernatorial campaign
and a national campaign?

520
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,403
-None.
-None of them?

521
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:17,323
You gotta be impressed
with my consistency.

522
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:20,880
-So let me ask you something.
-Sure.

523
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:26,526
How come you're drinking
so much so early in the day?

524
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,370
I'm about to get fired.

525
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,570
It was good meeting you.

526
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,242
That has less to do with overall
consumer spending...

527
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,527
...than it doe's with
the consumer price index.

528
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,928
The markets tend to be late in responding
to those trends...

529
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,206
...so you get what doctors
call a false positive.

530
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:05,849
The science of economics is a lot less
of an exact science than we pretend.

531
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:10,084
We build complex models
with thousands of variables...

532
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:12,283
...to predict how the economy
will work....

533
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:14,609
What's he gonna say?

534
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,009
-About what?
-lf he's asked the question.

535
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:20,085
-What question?
-The New England DFC.

536
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,806
I don't know.

537
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,531
-You talked to him, didn't you?
-Yeah.

538
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:26,282
-Well, what's he gonna say?
-I don't know.

539
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:28,565
You talked to him about
the New England DFC--

540
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,172
-Yes.
-You wrote him a memo?

541
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,603
-Yes.
-And I'm asking, what's he gonna say?

542
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:36,888
I have no new information since
the last time you asked me that question.

543
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,333
Let me put it another way.

544
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:42,606
You and your husband are paying
$600 more every year than you would...

545
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,932
...if you were unmarried
and filing individually.

546
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:47,974
Couples who live together
outside the covenant of marriage...

547
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,774
...do so for reasons
that have nothing....

548
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:53,286
You told him to go ahead and
piss off the dairy farmers, didn't you?

549
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,693
If he's asked about the
New England DFC...

550
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,173
...you told him to piss off
the dairy farmers.

551
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:04,525
I said that if asked about it tonight,
he should, if only because...

552
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,572
...it's the easiest thing to remember,
tell the truth.

553
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:11,246
-Do you enjoy losing?
-Not that much, no.

554
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:14,651
But then again, I really don't have
a lot to compare it to, so....

555
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:19,010
--the bulk of other previous losses,
which, in effect, is a much larger tax...

556
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,851
...on overstated, real profits.
-Yes.

557
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,577
-You didn't understand any of that, right?
-A little.

558
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,088
Me too. Yeah.

559
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:30,538
Governor Bartlet, when you were
a member of Congress...

560
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,129
...you voted against the New England
Dairy Farming Compact.

561
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,898
That vote hurt me, sir.

562
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:40,098
I'm a businessman, and that vote hurt me
to the tune of maybe 10 cents a gallon.

563
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,611
And I voted for you
three times for congressman.

564
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,130
I voted for you twice for governor.

565
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:50,173
And I'm here, sir, and I'd like
to ask you for an explanation.

566
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,861
Yeah. I screwed you on that one.

567
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:01,097
-I'm sorry?
-I screwed you. You got hosed.

568
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:04,135
-Sir, l--
-Not just you. A lot of my constituents.

569
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,539
I put the hammer to farms...

570
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:10,896
...in Concord, Salem, Laconia,
Pelham, Hampton, Hudson.

571
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:13,981
You guys got rogered but good.

572
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:17,255
Today, for the first time in history,
the largest group of Americans...

573
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,061
...Iiving in poverty are children.

574
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:23,455
One in five children live in the most
abject, dangerous, hopeless...

575
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:26,622
...backbreaking, gut-wrenching poverty
any of us could imagine.

576
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:29,099
One in five, and they're children.

577
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:33,582
If fidelity to freedom and democracy
is the code of our civic religion...

578
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:37,095
...then surely the code of our
humanity is faithful service to that...

579
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,945
...unwritten commandment that says,
"We shall give our children...

580
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,181
...better than we ourselves receive. "

581
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:45,020
Let me put it this way:

582
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:48,894
I voted against it because I didn't wanna
make it harder for people to buy milk.

583
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:52,137
I stopped some money from flowing
into your pocket. If that angers you...

584
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,065
...if you resent me, I respect that.

585
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:57,027
But if you expect anything different
from the president...

586
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:59,905
...you should vote for someone else.
Thanks very much, everybody.

587
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,782
Hope you enjoyed the chicken.

588
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:22,182
Jed, please. I want you
to lie still for a few hours.

589
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:24,620
-Mr. President?
-I wanna see him.

590
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,388
-ls he okay?
-I told him about Josh.

591
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:29,343
-Please, help me to the door.
-You should stay in bed.

592
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:33,903
Charlie brought me some clothes.
Please, let me see him.

593
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,425
-Okay. Just for a minute.
-Okay.

594
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:44,862
-What's next?
-The thing about saying the name.

595
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,379
I understand.

596
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,821
If I could just reframe
the point Cal was making--

597
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:52,302
I understood the point Cal was making.
I was sitting there when he made it...

598
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:55,583
...my ears are connected to my brain,
and I'm saying, what's next?

599
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:59,104
Sir, by repeating the name
of your opponent in public...

600
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,423
...you essentially give him
free advertising.

601
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:04,664
Cal thinks you should start
referring to him as "my opponent."

602
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:08,547
Or "the other guy,"  "the other side."
Maybe there are other suggestions.

603
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,870
You want me to refer to Senator John
Hoynes of Texas, who at the moment...

604
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,908
...has a 48-point lead for the Democratic
nomination as "the other guy"?

605
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:19,904
you're not afraid it's gonna make me
look like I can't remember his name?

606
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:24,392
I am. I think it's gonna make me
look like I can't remember his name.

607
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:27,871
I think it's gonna make me look addled.
It's gonna make me look dotty.

608
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:32,433
And even if it didn't make me look like
that, it would remain a stupid idea.

609
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:36,834
What's next? Nothing? Excellent.

610
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,304
Okay, what's next?

611
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:46,954
We have to talk about
what happened tonight.

612
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,356
I thought he did well. I'd like
to have seen more seats filled.

613
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:52,435
-That's not what I'm talking about.
-What?

614
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,668
The governor's answer tonight.

615
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:57,716
I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.

616
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:02,546
I am talking about the governor's answer
tonight. But I'm also talking about--

617
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,589
Every day there's-- Look, Toby,
we can talk about this with you here...

618
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:09,029
...or, if you're more comfortable--
-I don't have time...

619
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:13,352
...to make people comfortable. If change
has to be made, it has to be made.

620
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:18,075
-Jerry, Cal, Mack, Steve, you're fired.
-What?

621
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,872
-What?
-No kidding. It's moving day.

622
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,111
I want Toby.
The rest of you, thanks very much.

623
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,072
Fellas, look at my face. You're done.

624
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:46,999
Don't screw up.

625
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:58,195
It's freezing cold in October.
I don't know how you people live here.

626
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,474
-Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
-Yeah.

627
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:01,798
You fired him?

628
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:05,836
Yeah. And Jerry and Mack
and Steve and the other guy.

629
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:08,154
-ls there anyone you kept?
-I kept Toby Ziegler.

630
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:10,834
You kept Toby Ziegler
and you fired everybody else.

631
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:15,042
Toby's the only person working for us
I don't know, and he's the one you kept.

632
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,877
-Take him home, would you?
-Those were the only people I knew.

633
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,354
They were worthless.
It's time we bring in what we need.

634
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:23,397
-So you made that decision on your own?
-Yeah. You know why?

635
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,916
You're a crappy politician.
You'll find I'll be making...

636
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:28,879
...a lot of decisions on my own,
so get used to it.

637
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:30,876
I got elected to Congress by this state.

638
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:34,959
They sent me three times, and elected
me governor, all without your help.

639
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,403
-Don't start.
-No, seriously, that's a real...

640
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:40,837
...political accomplishment, considering
your family founded this state.

641
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:43,043
Were you opposed
in any of those elections?

642
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:46,644
-You got rid of all the people I know.
-Yeah.

643
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:48,406
Have a good night.

644
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:54,685
Why you doing this? You're a player.
You're bigger in the party than I am...

645
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,323
...Hoynes would make you
national chairman. Leo!

646
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:00,203
-Tell me this isn't one of the 12 steps.
-That's what it is.

647
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:02,559
After admitting we're powerless
over alcohol...

648
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:04,804
...and a higher power can restore us
to sanity.

649
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,318
-That's where you come in.
-Leo.

650
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:10,762
Because I'm tired of it, year after year
after year after year...

651
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,319
...having to choose between
the lesser of "Who cares? "

652
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:17,967
Trying to get excited about a candidate
who can speak in complete sentences.

653
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:21,200
Of setting the bar so low
I can hardly look at it.

654
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,930
They say a good man
can't get elected president.

655
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,125
I don't believe that. Do you?

656
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:31,770
-And you think I'm that man?
-Yes.

657
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:33,970
Doe'sn't it matter that I'm not as sure?

658
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:38,966
"Act as if ye hath faith
and faith shall be given to you."

659
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,050
Put another way,
"Fake it till you make it."

660
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,771
-You did good tonight.
-Yeah.

661
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:48,652
This is the time of Jed Bartlet, old friend.

662
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:52,165
you're gonna open your mouth
and lift houses off the ground.

663
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:56,651
Whole houses, clear off the ground.

664
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:01,093
And it's unknown at this time
whether or not the president...

665
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:05,812
...before going under anesthesia, signed
a letter that would give temporary....

666
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:07,971
--the White House
and George Washington Hospital...

667
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:11,691
...where several thousand people....
- Thousand people gathered behind...

668
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:16,526
...the police barricades. An impromptu
vigil with prayers being made....

669
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:20,814
--understandably are rocked on their
heels at this hour, to put it mildly.

670
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:26,216
Press Secretary C.J. Cregg has appeared
at her briefings to be distraught.

671
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:29,408
Officials at George Washington
University Hospital....

672
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,608
And in the fourth hour of a massive
manhunt for a third suspect...

673
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,571
...airports up and down the Atlantic
Coast are closed. National Guard units....

674
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:39,929
Washington and Baltimore report
massive delays, cancellations...

675
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,928
...and closures at major airports....

676
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,613
--rail stations, bus stations and harbors.

677
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:48,607
Travelers are strongly advised
to either wait or....

678
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:51,890
--Navy carrier groups, as well as the
32nd Marine Tactical Division...

679
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:54,215
...have been put on a state
of heightened alert.

680
00:40:54,498 --> 00:40:57,697
--Agent Ron Butterfield, head
of the president's Secret Service detail.

681
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:01,892
He was shot in the hand
during the attack on the president.

682
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,139
Look what happened.

683
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:24,139
