Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,279
-So, what's your problem?
-He did everything right.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,836
He did everything you do
if your intent is to perpetrate a fraud.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,553
We want to see some polling.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,512
-Why?
-We need to know what to do next.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,029
What questions could they ask
that won't trip an alarm?

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,639
Josh trusts Joey Lucas.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,550
We need you to put a poll in the field
without asking questions we can't ask.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,433
I was almost sure I saw you give
the president an injection.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,758
It was Betaseron. It reduces
the frequency of the attacks.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,431
T obacco has spent $380 million
to the government's 36.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,074
They perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,636
-They wanna get these people.
-We're not big tobacco.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,114
-Eagle's moving.
-He talked to her on the phone?

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,959
-At the airport.
-But he called her on the phone.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,718
-T o get her to the airport.
-But I'm saying...

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,751
...did she hang up the phone,
say to her friends:

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,996
"You're never gonna believe
why I'm getting on a plane? "

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,476
He told her she was coming out
to do polling on subsurface agriculture.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,877
-What the hell is that?
-It's vegetables that grow underground.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,153
He told her she was coming here to find
out if Americans were eating more beets.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,557
-Is this a joke?
-It was Josh, Mr. President.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,719
It was a job done well.
You want to start not trusting Josh?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,749
Let's go.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,518
-Where are we going?
-The basement.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,675
Why?

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,952
I don't Iike how it Iooks, the seven of us
meeting in the middle of the night.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,515
You Iike the way it Iooks
meeting in the basement?

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,870
Let's go.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,676
These numbers
are gonna be meaningless.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,235
A governor from an industrial state.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,273
It's posed as a hypothetical
before people have any education.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,632
No way to factor existing approval
numbers when it comes to trust matters.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Sagittarius.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,071
-Are they on their way?
-Y eah.

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,959
-They' re on their way?
-Y eah.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,591
Joey, your flight was all right?

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,428
Your flight was all okay?

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,035
These numbers aren't
gonna mean anything, right?

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,356
With the hypothetical
and Iack of context?

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,596
-PIus the pre-existing Ievel of trust?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,837
I'm saying, he's got numbers
Iike Walter Cronkite.

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,075
Y eah.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,989
Is there anything in there
that we'regonna Iike?

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,069
-We are, in fact, eating more beets.
-Okay.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,795
Good evening.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,798
Mr. President,
you remember Joey Lucas...

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,353
...and her interpreter, Kenny.

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,552
-Joey, did you make photocopies of that?
-No, sir.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,433
Good. Let's get started.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,070
Mr. President, I polled 1 1 70
registered voters in Michigan...

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,676
...giving their governor a hypothetical--

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,158
Excuse me. How many people
in this room know Kenny's Iast name?

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,549
It's fine.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,228
I believe this operation
is no Ionger covert.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,557
Mr. President, Kenny's
been with me for 1 1 years.

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,274
T o trust me is to trust him.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,833
-Josh?
-Y eah.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,192
Go ahead.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,632
1 1 70 registered voters
in Michigan were polled...

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,072
...giving their governor a hypothetical,
concealed, degenerative illness.

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,191
These are the results.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,632
" Do you agree that it's okay
for the governor to Iie about his health? "

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,072
Seventeen percent agree,
83 percent disagree.

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,477
"Would you be as Iikely or Iess Iikely
to vote for the governor...

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,240
... now that you know
he has a degenerative illness? "

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,876
Seventy-one percent say Iess Iikely.

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,278
The Iargest block of Iikely voters
are women over 55.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,678
78 percent of those women say they
wouldn't vote for a candidate with MS.

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,713
We just Iost FIorida.

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,108
This may be the worst stat, sir.

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,029
Seventy-four percent
believe MS to be fatal.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,629
They may be right.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,151
Sixty-two percent of Democrats
aren't gonna vote for you.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,591
Sixty-five percent of those describing
themselves as Iiberal...

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,916
...aren't gonna vote for you
because you Iied.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,031
Joey, is there any good news
in there at all?

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,559
No, sir.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,992
-Who's in Port-au-Prince right now?
-The U. N. observer group.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,155
Which consists of?

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,194
400 technical advisers and observers,
and 65 unarmed security specialists.

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,278
-And the OAS?
-They've got about 200 observers.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,833
What happened Iast night?

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,113
Citing improper permits, Col. Bazan's
soldiers surrounded Carrefour Liberté.

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,514
-Liberty Square.
-Yeah.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,029
T o prevent a victory rally
by supporters of Dessalines.

87
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,834
Some of the crowd refused
to disperse. Shots were fired.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,359
-Anybody killed?
-Two people.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,314
Rene Ducasse, the newly designated
minister of justice, was arrested...

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,159
...and soldiers have surrounded
the house of the chief justice.

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,918
They say, to protect him
from death threats.

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,792
Our intelligence says
he's under house arrest.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,275
Most troubling is personnel
carriers with Haitian troops...

94
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,153
... parked in front of every
police station in Port-au-Prince.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,434
This is a sign that the army plans to take
power from the Gendarme Nationale.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,279
-Where's the president-elect?
-Sir, we can't find him.

97
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,833
-I'm sorry?
-At this moment...

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,998
-...we can't find Dessalines.
-That's not the most troubling thing?

99
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,155
What do you mean--?

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,794
He never showed up for a 4 p. m.
conference with Gilbert T ass.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,389
Calls to the party headquarters
and his houses went unanswered.

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,070
Armed forces radio says he's fled
the country, but the Dominicans say no.

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,633
What about intelligence?

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,914
It's not Iike we can just call around.
It's chaos there. Nobody knows anything.

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,074
Leo?

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,358
Let's evacuate the nonessential
personnel from the embassy.

107
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,479
Any move to evacuate the embassy,
even the nonessentials...

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,752
...will be a signal of no confidence
in the Dessalines government.

109
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,032
At the moment, there is no Dessalines
government, and no Dessalines.

110
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,959
I just got done pulling
nine dead bodies out of Colombia.

111
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,993
Evacuate the nonessentials,
get some Marines at the embassy...

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,593
-...and somebody brief Fitzwallace.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,915
Sagittarius.

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,952
Why not a presidential address?
T en, 1 5 minutes.

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,596
" I have this illness. I concealed it.
I apologize.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,360
Let me tell you about it.
Let me reduce your fears. "

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,596
It's too cold.
He needs to be with the first Iady.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,234
In some decorative room?
Sitting with his wife weakens him.

119
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,113
Let's put him behind the Kennedy desk,
in the East Room--

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,790
He's gonna go on TV and say he Iied.
I don't want him doing it behind the seal.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,877
You think without the seal
people will forget he's president?

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,036
We'II do a 30-minute Iive special
for one of the news magazines.

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,231
-" Live, " Iive-to-tape or tape?
-Live.

124
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,998
I don't want a producer
editing what he says.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,112
-What if we want to edit what he says?
-That's our tough Iuck.

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,793
-When?
-How about Thursday night?

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,955
-Wednesday night.
-Why?

128
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,913
Thursday is where they pay their bills.
It's tough enough getting 30 minutes...

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,190
...and not telling them why
during May sweeps.

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,109
-Who gives a damn about May sweeps?
-They do, Sam.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,278
AII right, 30 minutes, Dateline special,
Wednesday night...

132
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,870
... night after tomorrow, president
and first Iady in the Mural Room.

133
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,877
We'II follow that
with a press conference.

134
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,230
-Why?
-T o control the story as Iong as possible.

135
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,273
Once he gets done with Russert
or Diane or Stone Phillips...

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,392
... I'II need every reporter
in a room where I can see them.

137
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,672
-Put a team of medical experts there.
-We have 48 hours to find them.

138
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,553
If we take him from the Mural Room
to a press conference...

139
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,273
...won't a smart reporter ask:

140
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,189
" Mr. President, aren't you planning
on seeking re-election? "

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,791
A smart rep--

142
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,511
T ed Baxter's gonna ask, " Mr. President,
are you planning to seek re-election? "

143
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,358
So we'regonna need
an answer to that too.

144
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,711
-Are you getting an 8-speaker stereo?
-No.

145
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,273
-Six speakers?
-No.

146
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,629
How many speakers?

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,831
I have two ears.
How many speakers do I need?

148
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,396
-At Ieast six and a subwoofer.
-I'm not getting a subwoofer.

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,629
-How about the tow package?
-The tow package?

150
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,193
-T o tow your boat.
-I don't have a boat.

151
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,717
-What about a camper?
-No.

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,673
-What do you tow?
-Groceries.

153
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,711
You could put those in the trunk.

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,319
-Tinted windows?
-Hey.

155
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,715
Hello, Josh.

156
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,478
Mrs. Landingham's picking up
a new car today.

157
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,636
-Really?
-I wish I hadn't told anyone.

158
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,671
Why do men think women
can't buy a car without a man?

159
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,668
It's an old stereotype, Mrs. L. Did you
get the extended service warranty?

160
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,155
-No.
-Women.

161
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,033
-What do you want?
-Leo wanted to see me.

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,117
-He's in his office.
-Did you get the tow package?

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,278
-See?
-He's in his office.

164
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,992
Margaret.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,877
-Where's Josh?
-He's on his way.

166
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,958
-He remembers where my office is?
-Calm down. I'm right here.

167
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,958
-He's right here.
-Get out.

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,278
-This report is staggering.
-I know.

169
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,396
Justice has 31 Iawyers and staff,
tobacco has 1 893 Iawyers...

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,433
...and 2783 paralegals.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,835
-This isn't a typo, right?
-No.

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,636
We've spent 8. 7 million on outside
counsel, they've spent 1 92.

173
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,197
The 61.3 million they've spent
on travel expenses is twice as much...

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,550
-...as we've spent on our entire case.
-Y es.

175
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,318
Who oversees the Justice
Department budget?

176
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,353
The subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and the Judiciary.

177
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,198
-Who's the ranking minority member?
-Ritter.

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,153
T alk to him and find out
what the problem is.

179
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,273
Josh, how's it going downstairs?

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,993
They'II have an answer by
the end of the day.

181
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,839
It's Iooking Iike 30 minutes on Dateline
and a press conference.

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,634
But, Leo, it's also Iooking Iike
any scenario is gonna require...

183
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,389
...a firm position from the president
on re-election.

184
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,672
Well, we'II have that answer
by the end of the day too.

185
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,233
-Will we?
-Yes.

186
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,477
He got Joey's numbers in the middle
of the night. Give me the day.

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,990
Don't you think it'd help him
if he had a discussion among--?

188
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,392
A discussion among the rest of us?

189
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,952
Excuse me.

190
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,031
-What?
-Two of Dessalines' bodyguards...

191
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,958
...were shot. We think
he's headed to our embassy.

192
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,991
-How do we know?
-Peter Bratt got a message through.

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,713
What is Peter Bratt doing there?

194
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,471
He went for the inauguration, and he may
have Dessalines in the trunk of his car.

195
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,238
-In the trunk of his car?
-Y es, sir.

196
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,908
-Did we evacuate the nonessentials?
-On their way.

197
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,917
A C-9 is waiting for them
on the runway.

198
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,476
If we don't take Dessalines,
he'II be convicted in a 20-minute trial...

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,353
...imprisoned for Iife
or probably executed by the junta.

200
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,791
This is an internal affair in Haiti.
The U.S. has no place choosing sides.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,594
Of course we'rechoosing sides.
There was a free election.

202
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,837
We saw to it. There was a free
election, and Dessalines won.

203
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,474
If we grant asylum,
we'II be in a standoff with Bazan.

204
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,831
Bazan can elevate his stature in Haiti
by staging a standoff with the U.S.

205
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,032
Bazan can surround the embassy, saying
he's searching for a wanted criminal...

206
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,595
...and he can take everyone
in the embassy hostage.

207
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,315
Mr. President, there will never be
real elections in Haiti...

208
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,715
...if the military thinks
it can kill the winner.

209
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,117
AIso, I'd Iike to point out, sir,
that we encouraged Dessalines to run.

210
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,517
In fact, we strongly encouraged it,
and now he's in the trunk of a car.

211
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,995
The car's at the gate.
I got the gate right here.

212
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,750
-Let him in.
-Sir.

213
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,669
-Let him in.
-T ell them to Iet him in.

214
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,990
He's in.

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,953
Do we put Hoynes up there
at the press conference?

216
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,197
-Put Hoynes up there?
-There's never been...

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,231
...a more important time
to emphasize the vice presidency.

218
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,034
The vice president's presence underlines
the health risk to the president.

219
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,596
The president anticipated this problem
with the selection of the vice president.

220
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,792
It'II also serve to underscore that he
anticipated the problem and didn't tell.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,117
Hoynes was one of the first to know.
If he's there, it's a demonstration...

222
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,038
...that he signed off
on the president's health.

223
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,708
He'II get bombarded with questions
about what he knew...

224
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,990
...and the press corps will impanel
themselves as a grand jury.

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,792
Then Iet them, C.J.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,878
-We did something wrong or we didn't.
-Well, fantastic, Sam.

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,833
I didn't realize it was that simple.

228
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,515
There's a situation developing in Port-
au-Prince. I have to get ready to brief.

229
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,472
Sam, can Josiah Bartlet
function as president?

230
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm not a medical expert.

231
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,070
Right.

232
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,196
Toby, there is responsibility, and the
future, and an obligation to the party.

233
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,713
If he's not gonna run, he's gotta point
to Hoynes and say, "This is our guy. "

234
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,071
And what if they ask Hoynes,
" In the meantime...

235
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,431
-...can Bartlet function as president? "
-He'II say yes.

236
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,190
What if he says,
" I'm not a medical expert"?

237
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,519
The president of Haiti was taken
to the embassy in the trunk of a car?

238
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,312
Yes.

239
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,115
-I've Iived too Iong.
-Don't go anywhere, because I need you.

240
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,993
I mean it. This will get worse
before it gets better.

241
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,795
You may be right, but Haiti's actually
not what I wanted to talk to you about.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,389
-T obacco?
-The president wants to get behind...

243
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,477
...a $30 million appropriations bill...

244
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,592
...the Justice Department's had
in your committee for months.

245
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,633
-They need money to continue the case.
-I know.

246
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,992
-Has the chairman scheduled a vote?
-He's not gonna.

247
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,519
He won't schedule a vote?

248
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,280
Kalmbach's gonna dance
with the girl that brung him.

249
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,118
How much tobacco money
has he taken?

250
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,594
-In the Iast campaign?
-Yeah.

251
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,916
Four hundred and sixty thousand
in PACs.

252
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,714
-Is there a nose count?
-Y eah, eight to seven against.

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,070
-AIong party Iines?
-No, believe it or not...

254
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,794
...we've got two Republicans,
they've got two Democrats.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,355
-They've got two Democrats?
-Warren and Rossitter.

256
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,790
Warren and Rossitter
aren't even from the South.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,991
They have ideological problems
with the case.

258
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,237
This is a phenomenally important case.
It's historic.

259
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,752
It has to be won, and we'refighting it
with paper clips and a slingshot.

260
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,316
We were wondering
when you guys were gonna notice.

261
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,152
-Hi.
-Hi.

262
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,510
-Have a seat.
-I was told you wanted to see me.

263
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,950
Y eah, Donna.

264
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,109
I'm gonna tell you something shocking...

265
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,914
...except we don't have time
to be shocked.

266
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,793
So I need you to just hear it
and go back to work.

267
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,558
Eight years ago, the president
was diagnosed with MS.

268
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,433
He concealed it during the election,
but we'regoing public...

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,473
...with a Iive network interview
and a press conference.

270
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,348
This is what Josh is gonna be working on
24 hours, and he'II need your help...

271
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,350
...and he's gonna need you to know.
And so I'm telling you.

272
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,271
You're the first person
on the assistant Ievel to find out.

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,029
Margaret doe'sn't know.
Bonnie and Ginger don't know.

274
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,437
Mrs. Landingham doe'sn't know.

275
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,192
Is the president in a Iot of pain
or discomfort right now?

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,198
-No, he's in remission.
-Okay.

277
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
Is there anything else?

278
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,714
I want to impress upon you
how important it is that this not be--

279
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,990
Yeah.

280
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,157
You wanna know
where you made your mistake?

281
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,588
I didn't make a mistake.

282
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,472
You probably did.
Here's where you went wrong.

283
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,318
-Where?
-You went to the dealership alone.

284
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,919
-Y es.
-That was a mistake.

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,588
Because the dealer would Ioad me up
with extras I don't need?

286
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,473
-That's right.
-Like a tow package?

287
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,477
How will you tow your camper
without a tow package?

288
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,590
I have never been camping.

289
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,559
Neither have I.
I was hoping you'd take me.

290
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,230
I'd be sitting there fishing, Iistening
to the Orioles on a transistor radio.

291
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,079
-What would I be doing?
-Warding off bears, that kind of thing.

292
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,874
-How much did you pay?
-We don't talk about money, dear.

293
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,718
Can you tell me how much
you paid below sticker?

294
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,309
-I didn't pay anything below sticker.
-What do you mean?

295
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,397
I didn't pay anything
above sticker either.

296
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,556
-Mrs. Landingham, seriously.
-Charlie--

297
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,398
-You paid sticker price?
-Y es.

298
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,794
-Why?
-That was the price.

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,433
-Mrs. --
-Says so right on the sticker.

300
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,755
-Who pays sticker price?
-I do.

301
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,520
-Let me go back there with you.
-I wasn't duped.

302
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,870
-You paid sticker price.
-I'm a government employee.

303
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,433
That doe'sn't mean you' re a fool.

304
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,279
No, but it means I'm not allowed
to accept gifts of a certain value.

305
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,357
-It's not a gift.
-Of course it is.

306
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,348
The price tag says one thing and the
dealer gives it to me for something Iess.

307
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,437
-That happens when you buy a car.
-Not me.

308
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,517
-I was Iooking for Leo.
-Situation Room.

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,150
That's usually a good sign.

310
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,990
-How many are they saying?
-They can't say.

311
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,156
-How many are they estimating?
-It changes every minute.

312
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,874
-How many this minute?
-Nancy, the cavalry.

313
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,516
-You guys need some adult supervision?
-No, we need the cavalry.

314
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,119
What's the Iatest estimate?

315
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,790
It's about 500 soldiers,
maybe 300 of them with AR-1 5s.

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,797
We sold those to them, right?

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,912
Well, until a few hours ago,
they were on our side.

318
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,553
-Still.
-Y eah.

319
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,159
AR-1 5s aren't the only thing
they've got.

320
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,909
They've got two Bradleys with 1 20 mm
cannons and a couple of artillery tubes.

321
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,270
-What do we have?
-37 Marines with M1 4s...

322
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,435
...and Beretta sidearms.

323
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,596
What happens when
the first shot is fired?

324
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,677
-Get me hooked up to operations.
-Y es.

325
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,112
Embassy Marines aren't Iawn jockeys.
They' re not decorative.

326
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,914
They' re trained in restraint,
and they' re trained well.

327
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,473
-Operations, ma'am.
-Thank you.

328
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,636
If they take the embassy,
how will we know?

329
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,989
Will they send a note?

330
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,431
Sidney, I need Com Con status.
This is a few minutes old.

331
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,712
There's no note, Leo.
They' re taking the embassy.

332
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,359
Fitz, this is Nancy.

333
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,588
I think we should mobilize the 880th
Hostage T ask Force out of Parris Island.

334
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,469
The USS Enterprise, as well as
amphibious carriers out of FIorida...

335
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,070
...are being dispatched to the region,
expected to be there in 36 hours.

336
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,592
Aircraft will be in a combat radius
of 3 to 400 miles within 1 2 hours.

337
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,360
You'II get more details on that
when the Pentagon briefs at 3.

338
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,788
-C.J.!
-Katie.

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,276
Should we read anything into the fact
that Pentagon's briefing, not State?

340
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,595
State will brief Iater.

341
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,358
Is one option recognizing
the Bazan government?

342
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,516
-There is no Bazan government.
-But is one--?

343
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,030
-You're not taking me there, Mark.
-Is the U.S. prepared to invade Haiti?

344
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,708
It should be clear that we'retalking
about two separate issues.

345
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,592
One is a democratically elected
president...

346
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,109
...whose people are being denied
their Ieader by an armed militia.

347
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,869
The other is the Iives of Americans
in the embassy and the Marines.

348
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,709
-You didn't answer my question.
-How about that? I'II be back.

349
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,676
-Is he here?
-He's in the Mural Room.

350
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,633
-I Iook all right?
-You Iook pretty tired.

351
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,354
That's what you' re saying to me?

352
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,952
There's nothing
I can get for you, Mr. Hacket?

353
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,958
No, Bonnie, thanks. I'm fine.

354
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,512
-Paul.
-Good afternoon, CIaudia.

355
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,631
Bonnie, would you
stand outside the door, please...

356
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,115
...and knock if anybody
wants to come in?

357
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,398
She took me in through the basement.

358
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,955
I've been in this building 300 times,
never came in through the basement.

359
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,072
-What do you got in front?
-The White House Press Corps.

360
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,078
-Yeah?
-I need 30 minutes, night after tomorrow.

361
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,999
-What are you guys planning for Haiti?
-It's not Haiti.

362
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,316
-What is it?
-I'm not gonna tell you.

363
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,748
What do I tell my news director?

364
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,188
-It's your network.
-It's not.

365
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,630
It belongs to a company
that belongs to stockholders.

366
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,114
What am I supposed to tell him?

367
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,197
That we need 30 minutes
Wednesday night.

368
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,753
On Wednesday morning,
I'II tell you why.

369
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,475
You pick the interviewer,
they'II have 1 0 hours to prepare.

370
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,478
-Just the president?
-The president and first Iady.

371
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,671
-On our set?
-In this room.

372
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,196
So we get the interviewer
and the network Iogo?

373
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,469
No network Iogo.

374
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,955
I've gotta get two other networks
and CNN to pick this up Iive.

375
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,639
Bad enough it's your guy and not theirs.

376
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,868
But they'II run Petticoat Junction before
they put your network brand on their air.

377
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,069
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

378
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,713
-Between friends.
-Y eah.

379
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,876
Is the water over your head?

380
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,519
No, the water's exactly at my head.

381
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,550
I'II talk to Jeremy.

382
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,194
We'II start to Ieak Wednesday
morning to soften the ground...

383
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,153
... but anything Ieaks before then and
I'II take my business across the street.

384
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,118
Y eah.

385
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,835
Well, I was surprised when Andy
gave me the nose count...

386
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,713
... because I wasn't aware of any ties
to tobacco you have.

387
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,353
-We don't.
-Y eah.

388
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,916
-I don't. Do you?
-No. We grow no tobacco in my state.

389
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,270
I'd have to check, but I don't think
I've taken contributions.

390
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,951
We are both former U S. attorneys
and it's the suit itself we find troubling.

391
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,355
The suit alleges
that the tobacco companies...

392
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,597
... have been engaged in a broad
conspiracy of Iies since the 1 950s.

393
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,313
-Y es.
-How exactly...

394
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,750
...will Justice Department
Iitigators demonstrate that?

395
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,669
Well, I'm not a Iitigator and I don't
work at the Justice Department...

396
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,155
...and there's a reason
for both of those things...

397
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,952
... but I don't think it's hard to prove...

398
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,038
...that the tobacco companies have Iied
since we already know they did.

399
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,119
Every surgeon general since 1 964
has warned the public about smoking.

400
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,914
And since 1 966,
through Congressional mandate...

401
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,634
...a pack of cigarettes
has had to carry a warning Iabel.

402
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,912
T urning around now and saying,
"We've been had, " is ridiculous.

403
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,031
You saying that people
who start smoking...

404
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,635
...and get addicted to nicotine
are too stupid to Iive?

405
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,196
No. I'm saying they' re too stupid
to be protected by the courts.

406
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,188
"T oo stupid to be--" Every day, the
Justice Department uncovers evidence...

407
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,437
...that cigarette companies knew,
far better than the rest of us...

408
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,835
...that smoking causes death
and disease.

409
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,589
T o say nothing of the CEOs
being the Iast seven people on Earth...

410
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,836
...to discover that nicotine
was addictive--

411
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,191
Your administration wants to prosecute
a suit they know is hopeless...

412
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,712
...so they score points at the expense
of an industry that funds your opponents.

413
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,672
It's politically correct extortion...

414
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,474
...and that's why it's unlikely
the appropriations bill...

415
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,114
...will make it out of the subcommittee.

416
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,469
It's almost 3:00.

417
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,117
By 7, 3000 new people
will have taken up smoking.

418
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,633
2,800 of them
will be under 1 8.

419
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,831
Thanks.

420
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,596
Good afternoon, ma'am.

421
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,231
Sagittarius.

422
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,474
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet.

423
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,628
What do we use this place for
when we'renot using it for this?

424
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,116
I think-- I know we used it to plan
some of the millennium things.

425
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,550
Didn't it used to be the photo office?

426
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,478
I don't know.
I could check it out.

427
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,797
-Would you Iike to sit down?
-Yeah.

428
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,115
We're talking about 30 minutes
with an interviewer.

429
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,357
The questions will be about the medical
history. No questions about the Iaw.

430
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,391
C.J. got them to agree to that?

431
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,636
She will Wednesday morning
when she tells them what it's about.

432
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,035
-Why will they agree?
-They'd Iose the story.

433
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,668
That's all right with me.

434
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,997
I'd Iike to go through the story,
get a sense of what you'II say...

435
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,431
... run it by OIiver Babish, spend a couple
of days going over it with you.

436
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,518
That sounds fun, but I'm
kind of seeing someone right now.

437
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,871
It's not serious, but it could be.
You know what I'm saying?

438
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,629
T en years ago,
he began experiencing fatigue...

439
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,630
...and signs of paraparesis
of the anterior femoral muscles.

440
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,399
-In Iaymen's terms?
-He had a tingling pain in his thigh.

441
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,197
-And those symptoms subsided?
-Y es.

442
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,914
And two years Iater?

443
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,596
My husband experienced neuropathy
and presented symptoms...

444
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,110
...of optic neuritis with partial
unilateral nerve paresis.

445
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,232
-Mrs. Bartlet--
-Dr. Bartlet.

446
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,911
Y es, ma'am.
The Ianguage you use--

447
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,714
Why aren't the president and I
doing this together?

448
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,989
I'm sorry?

449
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,077
Somebody's doing this
with the president...

450
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,750
...and I was asking why
we'renot doing it at the same time.

451
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,669
-Is it so you can compare our stories?
-Y es.

452
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,839
The Ianguage you use--

453
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,670
Two years Iater,
he felt numbing and dizziness.

454
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,673
-Look--
-Section 2635 of the guidelines...

455
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,395
...Iaid out in Ethical Conduct for
Employees of the Executive Branch...

456
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,990
...final regulations issued by the
U S. Office of Government Ethics--

457
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,796
Section 2635, wherein White House
employees are specifically enjoined...

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,470
...from receiving or soliciting gifts
over $20 in value.

459
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,309
They want to give me a $ 1 9 discount
on my car, I'II take it.

460
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,153
-He's waiting for you.
-Thank you.

461
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,353
What happened?

462
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,755
We shot three Haitian soldiers
on the runway.

463
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,589
-They boarded the plane?
-Ground traffic control stopped the plane.

464
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,918
When the soldiers boarded, they were
told they'd boarded a U S. Air Force C-9.

465
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,075
They were told to drop their weapons.
They were told again.

466
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,636
Two staff sergeants in the bulkhead
had a clear shot and took them.

467
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,673
They dumped the bodies on the tarmac
and made an emergency takeoff.

468
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,869
-Leo--
-Sir--

469
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,672
That wasn't supposed to happen.

470
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,509
I evacuated the nonessentials
specifically so that wouldn't happen.

471
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,199
-We--
-I gave the order six hours ago.

472
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,039
-They had to--
-Six hours ago, I gave the order!

473
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,992
What were they still doing on a runway?

474
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,589
They had to be collected.
They weren't all in one place.

475
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,597
-We shot three men--
-That's what you do.

476
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,552
-We what?
-A foreign hostile puts his foot...

477
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,149
...on an American military plane,
that's an attack.

478
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,555
Rules of engagement
give us every right to repel.

479
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,716
I'm sure they had
their handbooks with them.

480
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,913
These guys were there
to keep the plane on the ground.

481
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,997
-The plane is up in the air?
-Yes, sir.

482
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,428
What's happening on the ground?

483
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,790
We're communicating
through diplomatic back channels.

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,034
-Who are we using?
-The Canadian ambassador...

485
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,471
... Dominican intelligence.

486
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,240
-And what doe's Bazan want?
-Dessalines.

487
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,670
-On what charge?
-That as treasury minister...

488
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,553
... he embezzled $ 1 8 million
earmarked for humanitarian aid.

489
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,036
I'm sold.

490
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,394
Margaret, get me
the secretary of state.

491
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,160
You're right. I should be
bringing them in on re-election.

492
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,998
-I should be talking to them.
-Yeah.

493
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,236
I don't want to make
the same mistakes again.

494
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,910
Y eah. Not when there are so many
new mistakes we can make.

495
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,114
Let's start tonight. Around 9:00,
we'II meet in the residence.

496
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,838
Scott, I'm with the president. We're
gonna need to invoke 1 070 at OAS.

497
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,790
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Bob Cratchit.

498
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,434
Surely you have better things
to do than annoy me.

499
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,278
-Never. You bought a new car?
-Y es.

500
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,710
-And you paid sticker price?
-Section 2635--

501
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,196
You need to Iook at the next page,
subsection B, paragraph 4.

502
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,550
I could beat you up anytime I want, sir.

503
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,558
Secret Service would have you down
Iike a calf at a rodeo.

504
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,309
"The definition of gift excludes
opportunities and benefits...

505
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
...including favorable rates
and commercial discounts...

506
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,271
...available to the public at Iarge. "

507
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,791
-I did Iook at the next page.
-And?

508
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,596
I work next door to the Oval Office, sir.
Caesar's wife must be above reproach.

509
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,472
Is the reason you didn't tell me
you were getting a new car, you--?

510
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,988
Did you think I was gonna think
it was an extravagance?

511
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,272
You don't think I think
you should have a new car?

512
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,031
-Dolores, have you ever had a new car?
-No.

513
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,118
Henry would go
to Calvin Hilly in Concord...

514
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,312
...and Calvin would give him a good deal
on something reliable.

515
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,637
Let me find out what you were to pay,
and write a check for the difference.

516
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,877
Oh, no. Thank you,
but I'm buying this car myself.

517
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,798
This car is gonna feel good.

518
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,991
-Is it a nice one?
-It's a beauty.

519
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,675
It's blue.
It has air conditioning.

520
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,110
I told them I can roll down the
windows, but it comes with it.

521
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,511
Consumer Reports rates it very high.
It's very safe.

522
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,916
And when you get inside,
there's this....

523
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,712
-Smell?
-How did you know?

524
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,117
The smell of freedom, and the chemicals
they treat the dashboard with.

525
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,878
-When are you picking it up?
-Now.

526
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,069
Do me a favor.

527
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,477
Come back after you pick it up.
I'd Iike to talk to you about something.

528
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,114
And put the car in the driveway.
I'd Iike to kick the tires.

529
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,275
Why?

530
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,835
It's an expression, Fannie Mae.
Go get your car.

531
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,797
What happens is, basically,
that small stones in the inner ear...

532
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,468
...which respond to gravity
become dislodged...

533
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,433
...and that'II cause
benign positional vertigo.

534
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,108
-You all right?
-Y es, ma'am.

535
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,153
You sure you don't want
some acetylsalicylic acid?

536
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,158
-Aspirin, my brother.
-What a dumb major you had.

537
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,271
-Good evening.
-Oh, OIiver.

538
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,200
Do you know what peripheral
neuropathy indicates?

539
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,710
No, but I don't really care that much.
Sam, would you mind for a minute?

540
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,717
-No.
-B1 2 deficiency.

541
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,196
-Thank you.
-Sure.

542
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,034
-Mrs. Bartlet, I want to talk to you--
-Dr. Bartlet.

543
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,791
When did I stop being Dr. Bartlet?

544
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,638
When in the campaign did I decide...

545
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,832
...that women were gonna Iike me more
if I called myself " Mrs. "?

546
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,076
When did I decide
that women were that stupid?

547
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,271
Ma'am, I want you
to get your own Iawyer.

548
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,311
-I have my own Iawyer.
-Pat's a family Iawyer.

549
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,715
I want you to get someone for this.
I'II give you eight names.

550
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,036
You, Pat and the president whittle it
down to three, I'II pick the one.

551
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,515
Can we do this after the broadcast
Wednesday night?

552
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,793
No, I want you to do it right away. I
don't think you should do the broadcast.

553
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,468
-Why?
-You shouldn't answer without a Iawyer.

554
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,432
Sam said they' re not gonna
get into issues of Iegality.

555
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,551
I don't know how
they' re gonna avoid it.

556
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,069
Herman Vikram was the
original specialist, right?

557
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,236
It was Vikram who put him
on prednisone.

558
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,911
And then almost four years ago
you put him on interferon beta-1 b.

559
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,793
-Betaseron.
-Y eah.

560
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,917
-You did it, not Vikram.
-It was in consultation with Vikram.

561
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,155
He didn't write the prescription.

562
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,830
I thought that it would be wrong
to involve another doctor.

563
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,794
So you wrote these prescriptions
to yourself and had them filled where?

564
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,399
The Dunwich Women's Health CIinic.

565
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,830
-Then shipped to various Iocations?
-It was a campaign.

566
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,235
-One Iocation was Phoenix.
-Probably.

567
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,670
-Another was St. Louis.
-Y eah.

568
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,997
You violated the medical ethics rules
of three state boards:

569
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,317
New Hampshire,
Arizona and Missouri.

570
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,435
"The board may take disciplinary action
against any person...

571
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,393
...who has engaged in dishonest
or unprofessional conduct. "

572
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,194
They were extraordinary
circumstances, OIiver.

573
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,437
I gave my husband excellent
medical care...

574
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,835
...and I'II Iine up tenured professors
who'II say so.

575
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,508
-Did you keep medical records?
-No.

576
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,393
" --or any person who has failed to
maintain adequate medical records...

577
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,149
...or documentation on diagnostic
and therapeutic treatment. "

578
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,590
The AMA's code of ethics
pretty well spells out...

579
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,189
...the egregiousness of treating
your own family members.

580
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,552
We do it anyway. We write
prescriptions for migraines, antibiotics--

581
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,796
Can I ask you,
as the president's physician...

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,116
... have you asked him
if he's had extramarital affairs?

583
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,356
No.

584
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,031
Isn't that a crucial question in the
diagnosing of autoimmune diseases?

585
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,437
I'd Iike to be next to my husband
when he doe's this.

586
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,757
I'd Iike you to get your own Iawyer.

587
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,552
-Is there anything else?
-No.

588
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,193
Thank you, Dr. Bartlet.

589
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,878
You need this?

590
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,272
-I didn't even see you there.
-I haven't seen you all day.

591
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,392
I've been with, you know, tobacco.

592
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,797
-You need this?
-Y eah.

593
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,549
The president wants you at a meeting
tonight in the residence around 9:00.

594
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,996
I'II tell you what that is, that's the
BIue Ribbon Commission on reform.

595
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,191
I'm gonna be collecting benefits...

596
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,119
...or not by the time we get
this BIue Ribbon thing up.

597
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,709
-Josh.
-Y eah.

598
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,352
I'm trying-- See, this is why
I'II never have a career as a--

599
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,198
-Donna, what--?
-Sagittarius.

600
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,551
-You all right?
-Y eah.

601
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,229
There's an empty office
next to the conference room.

602
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,192
I moved two couches in,
pillows and blankets.

603
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,790
-C.J. putting the Iid on?
-Right now.

604
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,913
And Leo's ready for you now.

605
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,510
The OAS has agreed to meet
in an emergency session tomorrow...

606
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,199
... but we'rewaiting for confirmation.

607
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,154
-Can you tell us what you'II say?
-Y es, but first we'II say it to them.

608
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,078
A question on the Haitian casualties--

609
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,430
We've run out of time.
We'II pick it up tomorrow.

610
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,234
I'm calling a full Iid. Any developments
throughout the night, you'II be paged.

611
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,512
-Thank you for your patience, everybody.
-Thank you, C.J.

612
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,316
-Leo's ready for you.
-Thanks.

613
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,230
Leo, this is insane, plain and simple.

614
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,749
What's insane?
Oh, never mind. What isn't?

615
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,349
-You don't think it's crazy?
-I don't know what we'retalking about.

616
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,109
We're firming up strategy on what will
define the future of this presidency...

617
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,915
...and we don't know if this president
is interested in the future.

618
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,396
-We have to have a discussion tonight.
-We're having a discussion.

619
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,716
-When?
-T onight.

620
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,150
Okay, then.

621
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,794
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Josh.

622
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,437
Leo, would you excuse us for a second?
Toby, can I talk to you outside?

623
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,835
-You told Donna.
-Y eah.

624
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,474
-Why didn't you Iet me?
-You hadn't yet.

625
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,995
How'd she take it?

626
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,273
If everybody out there takes it
the way she did, we may be okay.

627
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,759
If a few more people in here took it
the way she did, that'd be all right too.

628
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,829
-Was that for me?
-That was for me.

629
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,309
T obacco.

630
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,715
Kalmbach's not gonna Iet it come
to a vote in the subcommittee...

631
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,639
...which is fine, because if he did,
it'd be 8-7 against.

632
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,068
-Party Iines?
-No.

633
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,910
We have Stacy and Miner, but
Warren and Rossitter are voting against.

634
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,554
They have ideological problems
with the case.

635
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,949
What do you wanna do?

636
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,276
Stick some dynamite
up Warren and Rossitter's ass.

637
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,790
The problem is Rossitter
sits on the Judiciary Committee...

638
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,117
...and I don't know how many enemies
on Judiciary we want to make.

639
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,992
Both of you, Iisten.

640
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,591
We're not gonna stop,
soften, detour, postpone...

641
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,032
...circumvent, obfuscate
or trade a single one of our goals...

642
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,959
...to allow for whatever
extracurricular nonsense...

643
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,073
...is coming our way in the next
few days, weeks and months.

644
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,159
When did we decide this?

645
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,110
Just now.
Light them up.

646
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,432
-You got a recommendation for me?
-30 minutes, Wednesday, Iive.

647
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,868
-Live-to-tape?
-Live.

648
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,196
-Mural Room?
-Y eah. They pick the interviewer.

649
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,631
It's carried on all the networks and CNN.
I give it to them 1 0 hours before.

650
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,149
Followed by a press conference.

651
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,352
There isn't another step until we know
what the president's intentions are.

652
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,757
We need a discussion,
and it can't wait another night.

653
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,313
-We're having a discussion.
-When?

654
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,794
-T onight.
-Really?

655
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,797
-That's great.
-Good evening.

656
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,389
Sam, what do you know?

657
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,512
I know that fluid accumulating
in the semicircular canals...

658
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,793
...of the vestibulocochlear nerve
is usually what'II account for dizziness.

659
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,152
Leo, I want to state right here, in terms
so plain and clear as to command their--

660
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,554
Meeting tonight.

661
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,990
The whole country is gonna assume
he's not running when he announces.

662
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,315
-We're having a meeting.
-The press--

663
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,795
-We're having a meeting.
-Really?

664
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,238
-That's great.
-Y eah.

665
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,591
Why doe'sn't everybody grab something
to eat, be back at 9...

666
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,917
...and you'II get called to come over
to the residence.

667
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,509
Josh, walk out with me.

668
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,989
I mean it,
set one off under these guys.

669
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,668
How about I have C.J.
make a statement at her briefing?

670
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,835
A strong statement.

671
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,716
"The president calls on Congress to fund
the Justice Department tobacco Iawsuit...

672
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,751
...at the Ievels necessary
to continue this Iitigation. "

673
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,951
"The American people
deserve their day in court. "

674
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,720
"This administration won't sit
on the bench while well-fed members...

675
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,878
...of the Appropriations Committee
choke off funding for a Iawsuit...

676
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,231
...aimed at the perpetrators of hundreds
of thousands of negligent homicides...

677
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,759
...while filling their
campaign war chests. "

678
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,871
Light them up.

679
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,392
Charlie?

680
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,195
Leo, there was an accident
at 1 8th and Potomac.

681
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,675
Mrs. Landingham was driving
her car back here.

682
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,916
-What happened?
-There was a drunk driver...

683
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,395
...and they ran the Iight
at 1 8th and Potomac.

684
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,559
-They ran it at a high speed.
-Charlie, is she all right?

685
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,437
No. She's dead.

686
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,550
-Is he alone?
-Y eah.
