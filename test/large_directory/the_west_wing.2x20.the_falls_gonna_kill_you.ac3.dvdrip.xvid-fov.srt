-Previously on The West Wing :
-You're scared of Babish.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,949
Like you' re not.
OIiver, I'm gonna tell you a story...

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,953
...and I need you to tell me
whether I've engaged 1 6 people...

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,196
...in a criminal conspiracy
to defraud the public...

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,958
...in order to win an election.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,072
Have you signed a document in which
you were asked about your health...

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,157
-...and did not disclose you have MS?
-No.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,753
-Toby?
-Y eah?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,672
-Why are you Iying to me?
-Charlie--

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,156
When Zoey and EIIie went to college,
they had to fill out a health form.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,278
Because she was 1 7,
a parent had to sign it.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,272
-And she Ieft off the MS?
-Y eah.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,153
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,271
-Did anyone see you come here?
-I don't know.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,630
-Why not?
-I wasn't paying that much attention.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,989
I wish you would.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,075
I walked from my office
to your office.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,078
-Is there press outside your office?
-Not at 5:30 a. m.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,431
When did you find out
about the president's MS?

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,119
Last night, when Leo told me.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,912
-Who else was there?
-Nobody.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,832
-Nobody else was in the room?
-No.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,554
Have you ever Iied
about the president's health?

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,398
-Should I have my Iawyer here?
-I'm your Iawyer.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,830
-You're the president's Iawyer.
-I'm White House counsel.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,359
Have you Iied about his health?

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,192
-When did he tell you?
-I'm sorry?

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,556
-When did the president tell you?
-Six days ago.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,279
-And Josh?
-Two days after that.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,238
-Toby?
-Two days before he told me.

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,953
Have you Iied
about the president's health?

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,270
-And Leo he told more than a year ago.
-Y eah.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,590
I've had this for six hours,
so giving me some room...

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,756
...wouldn't be out of Iine,
know what I'm saying?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,274
I have to ask you questions.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,678
The Iess you could be pissed at the world
for no reason, the better I think.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,591
-I don't know you.
-I'm sorry?

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,836
I was told to report to you,
I don't know you.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,268
-You've been here, what?
-Three months.

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,671
-Three months. Why should I trust you?
-I don't care if you trust me.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,434
-Imagine my shock.
-I've got better things to do.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,268
This is going really well so far.
It's hard to believe...

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,517
...that four different women
have sued you for divorce.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,315
You can do that if you want. I've been
through it with Josh and Toby...

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,198
... but you' re gonna have
to answer questions.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,998
-Either to you or...?
-A grand jury.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,668
-Compelled by?
-A Justice Department subpoena.

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,271
Well, I have to tell you it'II be the first
time I've been asked out in a while, so--

49
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,631
It's entirely possible that
the president has committed...

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,879
... multiple counts of a federal crime
to which you were an accomplice.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,997
That much has sunk in
in the Iast six hours.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,639
-Has it?
-Yes.

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,916
So why don't you knock off
the cutie-pie crap...

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,953
...and answer the damn question?!

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,959
What was the question?

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,113
Have you ever Iied about the president's
health? What is your answer?

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Many, many times.

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,919
-Mr. Connelly?
-Y es.

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,838
I'm Donna Moss,
Josh Lyman's assistant.

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,271
He's tied up with Mr. McGarry.
I hope you don't mind waiting.

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,993
No.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,276
Doe's anybody know if it's gonna rain
this afternoon? They' re asking me.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,278
-The paper said mid-afternoon.
-So we know it won't be that.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,552
-Call the Navy Y ard for me, would you?
-Y eah.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,835
-Donna.
-Y eah.

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,837
-Have you seen C.J.?
-No, what's so funny?

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,156
Ed just got a fax from....

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,914
I'm sorry. Ed got a fax from
a man named Byron T almadge.

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,556
He's the associate administrator
for NASA's Office of Space Cadets.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,954
-FIight.
-Office of Space FIight.

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,559
-The OSF.
-What'd the fax say?

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,916
A Chinese satellite
is gonna crash to Earth...

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,798
...and we don't know where and when.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,036
-Seriously?
-Y eah, it's right here in the fax.

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,229
A satellite is crashing to Earth
and NASA sent us a fax?

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,549
-Y eah.
-This is for real?

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,795
Yes.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,150
-A satellite is gonna crash into the Earth?
-Y es.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,590
-Why are you Iaughing?
-We thought it was funny.

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,756
What am I supposed to do with this?

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,958
The fax was for C.J.
Just give it to her when you see her.

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,913
Donna, they say it's not gonna rain
this afternoon.

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,711
Well, that's a relief.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,717
-Hear me out on this, okay?
-Y eah.

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,070
We want to see some polling.

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,748
-Why?
-We need to know what to do next.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,558
-We know what to do.
-We don't know...

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,873
...which is the more insurmountable
problem, the perception that--

89
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,475
We'II call back.

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,154
The perception that he's not physically
up to the job or that he Iied about it.

91
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,915
There's no way to gauge public opinion
on this until the issue occurs.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,515
Public opinion is gonna be shaped
by the press.

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,637
AII public opinion is shaped
by the press...

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,719
... but the fundamental foundation
already exists in their perception of--

95
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,712
-How are you gonna take a poll--?
-We can do it.

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,875
-Look--
-Leo.

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,554
I don't trust any of our people
and even if I did...

98
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,115
...what questions could they ask
that won't trip an alarm?

99
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,033
Josh trusts Joey Lucas.

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,151
-From California?
-Y eah, she's flying in.

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,556
-What did you tell her?
-That we were commissioning a poll...

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,991
...to explore attitudes toward
subsurface agricultural products.

103
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,392
-Subsurface agricultural--
-Underground.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,352
-What the hell--?
-Americans eat more beets.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,511
-Beets?
-Y eah.

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,993
-AII right.
-Okay?

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,472
Y eah.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,759
Toby, you want to talk about
when we tell Sam?

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,515
-I wouldn't do it right now.
-Why?

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,836
His head is in the SME speech
for Chicago.

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,439
-The thing--
-Hang on.

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,790
His head is in Chicago.
That's where we need it.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,116
Would you want to write the speech
with this around your neck?

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,072
No.

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,675
The president wants him to know
by the end of the day.

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,469
-The end of the day, then.
-Okay.

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,152
-Anything else?
-No, thanks.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,920
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,351
-When doe's she get here?
-6:00.

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,073
-You do this carefully.
-No kidding.

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,635
You trust this person?

122
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,558
I gotta trust somebody right now.

123
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,036
Good, because I don't trust
anybody right now.

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,151
-Josh?
-Y eah.

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,669
A fax was sent to the Press Office
from the Office of Space FIight at NASA.

126
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,713
A Chinese satellite called Zodiac
has fallen out of its orbit...

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,559
...and will be falling to Earth
at an unspecified time and place.

128
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,035
-What are you telling me for?
-What am I telling you for?

129
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,789
This thing is falling to Earth.
Isn't there something we do?

130
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,076
-Like what?
-Like sound the alarm, I don't know.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,918
-Sound the alarm?
-There is no alarm.

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,633
-There's really not. Martin?
-Y es.

133
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,273
-Sorry to keep you.
-That's okay.

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,438
Come on back. The fax is for
the Press Office. Give it to them.

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,473
The deputies are at breakfast
and I don't know where C.J. is.

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,956
Martin, you can have a seat
in my office.

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,274
C.J. 's meeting with Babish.
I'II be inside.

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,278
-You're not concerned about this?
-No.

139
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,034
-I apologize again.
-No, that's all right.

140
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,074
-I assume you know why I'm here.
-I don't, actually.

141
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,992
-Mac Sheridan was gonna talk to you.
-I have a call to return to Mac.

142
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,479
-I should wait until he talks to you.
-Why don't you talk to me now?

143
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,118
The case is running out of money.

144
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,431
-Which case?
-The USV--

145
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,119
-You're kidding me.
-No.

146
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,749
Martin, we spent 1 3 million
the first year...

147
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,918
... 23 million the second.
Where's the money going?

148
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,350
Outside counsel and staff, depositions...

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,711
...expert witnesses, processing,
database, research--

150
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,914
We have 31 Iawyers on a case
against five tobacco companies...

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,634
...just one of which has 342.

152
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,509
We won't count the 1 3 subsidiaries
that have mounted their own defense.

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,748
T obacco has spent $380 million
to the government's 36.

154
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,997
When I come asking for money, it's
not because the Justice Department...

155
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,236
... blew its allowance on video games.

156
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,596
-I should've Iet Mac talk to you first.
-Aren't you allowed to transfer funds--?

157
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,199
That's what we've been doing.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,829
We've transferred money
from Health and Human Services...

159
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,555
...to pay for the Iawsuit,
but then the House passed H. R. 260...

160
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,518
-...and now the committees--
-Y eah.

161
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,069
-You understand?
-Y eah, Iet me run it by Leo.

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,957
-This is a fight worth winning.
-You don't have to convince me.

163
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,395
These people perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

164
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,959
I'm sorry?

165
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,675
I said, they perpetrated a fraud
against the public.

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,790
-The tobacco companies?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,632
Well, I'm gonna talk to Leo,
and I'II tell Mac you were here.

168
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,598
Thank you.

169
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,113
Let me just finish this.

170
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,592
He was hemodynamically stable
with a blood pressure of 140/80.

171
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,552
Cholesterol level is 185.

172
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,514
The QRS interval on the EKG
is slightly long, but otherwise good.

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,951
The president is pronounced
in excellent physical health.

174
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,197
-Was that March of Iast year?
-How many times have you done that?

175
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,670
-I'd have to go and check.
-Estimate.

176
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,316
If that was March of Iast year,
then that was his fourth physical.

177
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,272
A couple of times
during the campaign.

178
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,118
-And after the shooting.
-Y eah?

179
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,511
-The time he rode his bicycle into a tree.
-When he sprained his ankle?

180
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,233
T ell me how it works.

181
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,159
-What do you mean?
-When the president has a physical.

182
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,557
The president's physician....
Right now it's Admiral Leonard Morrow.

183
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,673
The president's physician calls and gives
me a short statement, including vitals.

184
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,199
-Then you make a statement?
-Yeah.

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,392
-Do you speak to the president before?
-Y es.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,955
-Why?
-Because of doctor-patient confidentiality.

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,674
-You only get so much from the doctor.
-What do you ask?

188
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,519
" Is there anything I should know
the doctors won't tell me? "

189
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,637
-I'm gonna ask you something.
-What?

190
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,552
Do you say, " Is there anything
I should know? "

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,035
Or do you say,
" Is there anything I need to know? "

192
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,071
-What doe's it matter?
-Which do you say?

193
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
" Is there anything I need to know? "
implies you want to know enough...

194
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,116
...to face reporters
while maintaining deniability.

195
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,237
-It's an expression.
-Did you use it?

196
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,755
I really don't remember, I don't.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,389
-I don't choose words that carefully.
-With the president?

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,952
-You think I speak to him in code?
-No, I was just asking.

199
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,191
Yeah.

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,438
Excuse me. C.J., this is a note
from Donna Moss.

201
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,394
-She wanted you to see it right away.
-Thanks.

202
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,679
The sky is falling down.

203
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,471
"The debate over a tax cut,
whether to have one or not...

204
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,318
... how Iarge it should be,
how small it should be...

205
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,153
...what share should be received
by whom. AII of this, my friends...

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,114
...is the wrong debate at the wrong time
over the wrong issue. "

207
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,595
-We need to get back to fundamentals.
-Where is that?

208
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,831
-Where's what?
-"We need to get back to fundamentals. "

209
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,272
It's not in the speech, I'm saying it.
We need to get back to fundamentals.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,231
Excuse me. Think about fundamentals.

211
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,512
-You ready for some good news?
-Y eah.

212
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,950
Not out here.

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,712
This is gonna be a front-page story.

214
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,309
There's a front-page story
I don't know about yet?

215
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,075
-You'II know about it in two hours.
-But I'm gonna know about it now, right?

216
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
The CBO's gonna issue
a new estimate of the surplus.

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,439
-They' re projecting down?
-Y eah.

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,993
-We don't have as much money?
-No.

219
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,235
-That's great news.
-Y eah.

220
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,637
It's not great news we have Iess money.
The floor fight's gonna be easier.

221
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,313
-Y eah.
-How much Iess money?

222
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,399
Eight years out it's 200 billion Iess.
Nine years out it's 400 billion Iess.

223
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,715
-That is great.
-Yep.

224
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,309
-It's not great that we have--
-We get why it's great.

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,232
I can't tell you how much this helps.

226
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,635
I'm drafting the SME speech
for Chicago--

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,235
That's why we'retelling you.
There's a Iine that ATJ...

228
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,192
...and the Progressive Caucus
want in the speech--

229
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,958
I got it here.

230
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,476
"We want a real tax cut
for working families...

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,750
...to help them pay
for education and housing...

232
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,030
...while our opponents
want to help the rich...

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,073
... pay for bigger swimming pools
and faster private jets. "

234
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,078
-No, I don't think so.
-They want it in. Why not?

235
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,117
-It's bad writing.
-Change the writing.

236
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,476
-"Summer homes and sports cars. "
-The poetry is not my problem.

237
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,871
-They want it in Chicago.
-Well, tell them to do their own speech.

238
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,439
-You want to tell them that?
-No.

239
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,557
-Okay.
-We have Iess money?

240
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,314
-Isn't that great?
-Y es, it is. Thanks.

241
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,757
Are you aware that a year ago January
the president had an attack?

242
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,871
-I am now.
-You were there when he collapsed.

243
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,115
I was outside the room.

244
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,590
-You went in and he was unconscious.
-Y es.

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,199
What made you go into the room?

246
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,437
The sound of a Steuben glass pitcher
crashing to the floor.

247
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,551
-What'd you think had happened?
-I didn't know.

248
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,591
Well, what'd you think?

249
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,509
At first glance,
I thought he might have a virus...

250
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,110
...contracted from a rare African
tsetse fly, possibly tropical sprue.

251
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,515
I'm not an expert,
but I did meet a man in India.

252
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,911
It could be anything with presidents.
James Polk had diverticulitis.

253
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,912
-Yeah.
-He couldn't digest nuts.

254
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,550
One in 40 American men wear women's
clothing. We've had over 40 presidents.

255
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,032
One of these guys was dancing
around the Oval Office in a prom dress.

256
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,673
Let's get to the bottom of that.

257
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,672
-C.J.?
-Y eah.

258
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,474
In my entire Iife
I've never found anything charming.

259
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,508
Really?

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
-You announced that it was the flu.
-Y es.

261
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,432
-Who told you to say it?
-I wasn't told to say it was the flu...

262
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,154
... I was told it was the flu.
I'm not getting into that.

263
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,279
I'm not getting into who said what.
We can do that at the next session.

264
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,439
Okay. Do you know what time it is?

265
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,470
It's five past noon.

266
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,830
I'd Iike you to get out
of the habit of doing that.

267
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,838
-Doing what?
-Answering more than was asked.

268
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,313
Do you know what time it is?

269
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,832
Yes.

270
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,957
We'II take a break
and meet again Iater today.

271
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,872
-Hey.
-You see this?

272
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,674
-That was nice.
-Good reviews on the speech.

273
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,836
-Y eah.
-From Maynard Wachtel of all places.

274
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,992
-You got a second?
-He calls you and me Batman and Robin.

275
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,435
-I don't think he doe's--
-He doe'sn't, but he should...

276
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,073
-... because that's what we are.
-Okay.

277
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,639
We're Batman and Robin.

278
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,269
-Which one's which?
-Look at me, Sam, am I Robin?

279
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,435
-I'm not Robin.
-Yes, you are.

280
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,108
-Okay, well, Iet's move off this.
-You bet, Iittle friend.

281
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,118
-We're not Batman and Robin.
-We'II keep those identities secret.

282
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,231
I'm Bruce Wayne and you' re my ward.

283
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,396
-Dick something.
-Jane Gentry and Richard Will...

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,636
...came to me with news.
The CBO's projection--

285
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,832
-Really?
-Y es, has us 200 billion Iower in 8 years.

286
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,076
-That's fantastic news.
-Y es.

287
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,872
-When is this real?
-This afternoon.

288
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,275
-The projections are Iower?
-Measurably Iower.

289
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,873
I'm so happy I could spit.

290
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,550
This is the first administration in history
to favor slower economic growth.

291
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,558
I favor it when it gives us a bat
and ball on tax cuts.

292
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,832
We offer them a deal, we Iower
the bottom rate from 1 5 to 1 0%...

293
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,033
... but we stand our ground on no tax cut
in the top bracket, and you know why?

294
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,231
Because we might not
be able to afford it.

295
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,431
-Isn't it great?
-Y eah, it's Christmas in Paris.

296
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,633
There's a Iine ATJ and the Progressive
Caucus want put in the draft for Chicago.

297
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,559
-What?
-That we want to do great things...

298
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,957
... but our opponents want bigger
swimming pools and faster private jets.

299
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,918
-Their private jets are too slow?
-Toby--

300
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,917
-Change the writing.
-It's not the writing....

301
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,917
I know.

302
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,349
-Listen.
-Y eah.

303
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,912
-Nothing.
-Okay.

304
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,838
Don't worry about it.

305
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,719
-So--
-I have to go to a meeting.

306
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,071
-T alk to somebody at ATJ or the Caucus.
-Okay. I'm gonna do that, then.

307
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,271
Y eah. Okay.

308
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,029
-Hey, Donna.
-Hey, Charlie.

309
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,592
-Is there anything you need?
-Nope. Just came in to say hi.

310
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,910
-How you doing?
-Good.

311
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,190
So NASA's OSF tells us
that the 30th Space Wing...

312
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,472
...at Vandenberg Air Force Base
believes that a Chinese satellite...

313
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,513
... has fallen out of its orbital flight plan.

314
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,349
The Iast detection the 30th had
placed it in what they call...

315
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,558
...a "degrading orbital path. "
And it's now dropped off their radar...

316
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,479
...suggesting it's begun to fall
toward the Earth's atmosphere.

317
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,517
-Cool.
-What's the matter with you people?

318
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,870
-What'd I do?
-A thing the size of a garbage truck...

319
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,992
...is in a 2000-mile-an-hour free fall
and no one knows where it'II hit.

320
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,231
I'II root for Zurich.
I've had it with the Swiss.

321
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,754
-You don't--
-Hang on.

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,639
Excuse me.

323
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,431
-Good afternoon.
-Welcome back, Mrs. Bartlet.

324
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,154
-Thank you.
-A couple of reminders.

325
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,595
You're at the board
of the Children's Cancer Fund...

326
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,189
-...at the Sheraton at 3--
-Before that I wanna be--

327
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,709
You're gonna read
at the Head Start Program.

328
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,309
-Welcome back, Mrs. Bartlet.
-Snappy suit, Bobby.

329
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,318
-How did it go yesterday?
-I got a helicopter named after me.

330
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,196
-Y eah?
-An AS 335 F1 Twinstar named Abigail.

331
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,073
I got to break a bottle
of cider over its nose. Charlie.

332
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,748
-Welcome back, ma'am.
-Thank you. Where's the president?

333
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,679
-He's waiting for you inside.
-Thank you.

334
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,192
Hey.

335
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,555
-Hi.
-Welcome back.

336
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,638
-How come I just found out about this?
-How was the flight?

337
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,673
-How come I just found out about this?
-When Leo talked to you...

338
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,156
-... he thought you already knew.
-You think I'm saying this is Leo's fault?

339
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,555
I'm asking how come
you didn't tell me Iast week?

340
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,432
And I'm saying we still do this.

341
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,070
We're husband and wife and parents
and before we Iaunch into intrigue...

342
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,794
...we do
"Welcome back, how was the flight? "

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,355
-What happened?
-One of the forms Zoey had to fill out...

344
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,438
...for Georgetown
asks for a family medical history.

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,153
Y es.

346
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,954
-Did Leo tell you the rest?
-Not after he realized that you...

347
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,390
... hadn't told me already,
which is a subject...

348
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,716
... I assure you, we will be returning to.

349
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,799
Zoey wasn't 1 8 yet when she started.
A parent had to sign the form.

350
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,508
-Did you sign it?
-No, you did, hot pants.

351
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,392
-I signed it?
-It's gonna be okay.

352
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,349
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?
We talk on the phone three times a day!

353
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,990
Because I didn't! Because that's--
Because I didn't.

354
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,790
I talked to Zoey this morning,
she's gonna ace her finals.

355
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,391
-She told me.
-I hate EIIie's boyfriend.

356
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,028
She told me.

357
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,989
I need you to speak
to the White House counsel, Abbey.

358
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,159
I know.

359
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,718
Hey.

360
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,957
-The first Iady's back?
-Yeah.

361
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,677
I was talking to her on the phone
and I mentioned Zoey's application...

362
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,155
...without realizing the president
hadn't told her.

363
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,595
-Why hadn't the president told her?
-What do you want?

364
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,319
-Thirty million dollars.
-No.

365
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,711
Martin Connelly, assistant attorney
general, says they' re out of money.

366
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,393
-On the suit?
-Y eah.

367
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,797
-They' re always out of money.
-We don't give enough.

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,958
We passed a Iaw Iast summer that says
they can transfer funds...

369
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,515
...from Commerce,
from Health and Human Services.

370
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,315
They can take it from Veterans Affairs
up to, what? I think $ 1 2 million.

371
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,597
The problem is the Iaw says
those transfers are subject to approval...

372
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,950
... by House committees,
each of which has a chairman...

373
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,958
...elected with the $8 million
tobacco spent in the Iast election.

374
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,432
Even then it wouldn't matter, because
1 2 million isn't gonna get it done.

375
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,752
-Neither is 30 million.
-Then Iet's give them more. Why not?

376
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,949
Because we'regonna Iose.

377
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,839
-Give them enough to win.
-And Iiquidate the Grand T etons?

378
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,470
They' re saying 30 million
and I think it's a steal at twice the price.

379
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,393
Staff it out to some people
and report to me on it in, what...?

380
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,192
-Two, three days?
-Good.

381
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,551
I'm going out to the airport.

382
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,190
AII right. Do a job.

383
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,516
Y eah.

384
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,199
-Hi.
-Hey, Sam.

385
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,551
-Henry. Helen. Hey, Bruce.
-How you doing, Sam?

386
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,910
Lewis. We just have
a few minutes, right?

387
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,356
-There's a caucus.
-You've heard the good news.

388
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,034
The CBO, projected eight years out,
has the budget surplus...

389
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,798
...coming in $200 billion Iower.

390
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,349
-That's great.
-There's something wrong with us...

391
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,073
... but that's for a different time.

392
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,794
I wanted to mention that
Jane Gentry and Richard Will...

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,116
...say you guys want a Iine
in the Chicago draft.

394
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,312
-Jet planes and swimming pools.
-" Our opponents want to help the rich...

395
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,078
... pay for bigger swimming pools
and faster private jets. "

396
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,469
-Y eah.
-Hit them hard.

397
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,756
We are hitting hard.
I'm not gonna use the Iine.

398
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,991
-Why not?
-First of all, it's bad writing.

399
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
-What's wrong with it?
-Sounds Iike a high school girl wrote it.

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,353
Is something wrong
with how women write?

401
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,716
-There is when she's in high school.
-Sam!

402
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,077
It's not the writing. Come on,
faster private jets and swimming pools?

403
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,993
-We can take out the heavy bats now.
-And do what with them?

404
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,913
-The Iine works.
-So doe's " How about them Cowboys? "...

405
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,350
...when you' re in Dallas, but it
won't change the mind...

406
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,391
...of anyone who doe'sn't already agree.

407
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,676
Are you in favor of tax cuts
for the wealthy?

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,639
I am not. I am in favor of tax cuts...

409
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,593
...for whom it will do the most good.
That's a tough enough battle.

410
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,956
It Iooks Iike we've got a fair fight.

411
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,151
I'm not talking about policy,
I'm talking about rhetoric...

412
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
...and the men you work for
need to dial it down to five.

413
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,038
Henry, Iast fall, every time your boss
got on the stump and said :

414
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,437
" It's time for the rich to pay
their fair share, " I hid under a couch.

415
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,636
I Ieft Gage Whitney making
400,000 a year...

416
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,917
...which means I paid 27 times
the national average in income tax.

417
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,078
I paid my fair share.
And the fair share of 26 other people.

418
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,517
And I'm happy to, because
that's the only way it's gonna work.

419
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,395
It's in my best interest that everybody
go to schools and drive on roads.

420
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,996
But I don't get 27 votes,
the fire department doe'sn't come...

421
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,556
... 27 times faster, and water doe'sn't
come out of my faucet 27 times hotter.

422
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,231
The top 1 % of wage earners in this
country pay for 22% of this country.

423
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,317
Let's not call them names
while they do it.

424
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,353
-You're not using the Iine?
-No.

425
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,794
-Or anything Iike it?
-No.

426
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,759
Make it clear to your people
this has nothing to do...

427
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,158
-...with cozying up to Republicans.
-No, why would they think that?

428
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,758
We've got a caucus.

429
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,751
I know women who can write, Helen.

430
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,554
I know women who can blow
the walls off brick buildings.

431
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,432
This sounds Iike a girl.

432
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,273
-Airlines flight 1 106 arriving....
-Joey.

433
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,795
-Joey, how you doing?
-Hi.

434
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,312
-I'm Josh Lyman.
-Dale Bracket.

435
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,431
What happened to Kenny?

436
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,909
He' s on vacation.

437
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,476
-So you' re the substitute interpreter?
-Y eah.

438
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,950
-You came here to pick me up?
-Not exactly.

439
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,277
Dale, I'm gonna ask you
to wait over here, okay?

440
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,150
Joey, you' re gonna read my Iips,
and if I can't understand...

441
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,437
...what you' re saying
you'II write it down, all right?

442
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,313
-Okay.
-Excuse us.

443
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,077
-Dale?
-Y es.

444
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,113
He's pretty good-Iooking
for an interpreter, wouldn't you say?

445
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,992
He's good-Iooking for anybody.

446
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,350
-Dale Bracket?
-Y es.

447
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,916
And he's not a television detective?

448
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,673
We can't talk about this in the car?

449
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,311
-I'm sorry?
-We can't talk about this in the car?

450
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,593
-You're not getting in the car.
-Why?

451
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,796
Because you' re getting back on a plane
in an hour and 1 0 minutes.

452
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,070
AII right, if we sit Iike this,
can Dale Bracket, PI read my Iips?

453
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,312
No.

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,192
Okay.

455
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,792
You're not talking to me
about an agriculture poll.

456
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,995
-No kidding.
-You guessed that?

457
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,993
We think we'reeating more beets?

458
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,556
Well, we are, but that's not important.

459
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,435
Well, what's important?

460
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,997
-Hi, what can I get for you?
-Cranberry juice and club soda...

461
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,749
...and I'II have a Iarge glass of ice water.

462
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,151
I told Leo McGarry that we could
trust you and Toby backed me up.

463
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,359
What's important?

464
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,950
Eight years ago...

465
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,188
...the president was diagnosed
with an illness that was never disclosed.

466
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,278
Y es.

467
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,076
What is it?

468
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,394
Cranberry and club...

469
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,394
...and a Iarge glass of ice water.

470
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,871
-Excuse me, the first Iady.
-Thank you.

471
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,392
-OIiver.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet.

472
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,999
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you.

473
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,158
I haven't been in this office
since you moved in. It Iooks great.

474
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,918
-Thank you.
-I haven't come in here...

475
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,759
... because it seems that
every time I do, there's a new counsel.

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,270
Leo keeps them in the basement Iike
those Iadies in Arsenic and Old Lace.

477
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,198
-Y eah.
-Anyway...

478
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,949
...the president's very glad you' re here,
particularly in this time of nonsense.

479
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,832
Would you mind if I asked
a few questions?

480
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,793
I'm not as experienced in this
as the senior staff.

481
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,356
I read a book about Daniel Webster.
I read a book about Benjamin Disraeli.

482
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,676
What experience I do have
is with dead Iawyers.

483
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,592
Just out of curiosity,
how'd they die?

484
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,837
If you' re under the impression
you' re the fifth White House counsel...

485
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,032
...instead of the first because of me,
you' re mistaken, OIiver.

486
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,192
I wasn't under that impression,
but we should stick to the matter.

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,558
-You want to ask me some questions.
-Y es.

488
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,876
-About Zoey's health form.
-Y ep.

489
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,550
It was a form. It asked for, among
other things, a family's medical history.

490
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,634
It was blank. It was a form, one of many
forms. I signed it without reading it.

491
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,838
-Was anyone in the room?
-It was a year ago, I don't remember.

492
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,156
-Was the president in the room?
-I don't remember.

493
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,914
When I ask the president that,
he's gonna tell the truth.

494
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,513
And the president will also resent your
implication that I didn't do the same.

495
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,752
-The president wasn't in the room?
-I don't remember. He doe'sn't remember.

496
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,554
-Mrs. Bartlet--
-OIiver, you have kids. There are forms.

497
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,837
School trips and soccer
and band uniforms...

498
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,554
...and report cards
and notes to get out of gym.

499
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,995
-You signed those forms.
-Their mother signs them.

500
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,595
So do I. And by the way,
when you' re the daughter...

501
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,395
...of the president of the United States,
there's a Iot more forms on top of that.

502
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,755
-I understand.
-Do you?

503
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,520
Y es, but a Iawyer half my size...

504
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,632
...while cross-examining you,
will say the following :

505
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,558
" Do you have an MD
from Harvard?

506
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,393
Are you certified in internal medicine?
Are you certified in thoracic surgery?

507
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,948
Are you a professor at Harvard?
Are you on the staff at Boston Mercy?

508
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,628
Have you practiced medicine
for 26 years?

509
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,519
Are you not able to recognize
a medical history form...

510
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,994
...when it is in front of you? "

511
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,754
I didn't read it.
I didn't think it was important.

512
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,594
"What else have you signed
without thinking? Prescriptions?

513
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,398
Patient instructions?
So just this? "

514
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,871
OIiver, I am not an expert on diseases
of the central nervous system...

515
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,674
... but I can tell you
that MS is not hereditary.

516
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,635
The president's condition has absolutely
no relevance to Zoey's health status.

517
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,440
-Now you' re changing your story.
-No, I'm not.

518
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,796
Did you sign it because
you were absent-minded...

519
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,757
-...or because you knew best?
-I signed it because-- I just signed it.

520
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,190
It was a form.

521
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,272
Making a big thing out of it
is what makes it into a big thing.

522
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,830
-Really?
-And I'm not 100% sure...

523
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,519
...that's not what you' re going for.

524
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,513
-Why would I want it to be a big thing?
-Because defending the president...

525
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,553
...in prime time Iooks good
on a résumé.

526
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,115
Well, I've got a pretty good-Iooking
résumé already...

527
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,949
...and it's not a big thing because
I say so, ma'am. It's a big thing.

528
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,795
You'II get all the questions
I just asked and more.

529
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,794
And then they' re gonna ask the president
if he was in the room when you signed it.

530
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,753
And that's when he's gonna give
everyone's favorite answer...

531
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,954
...from a president who has announced
that he has MS, " I don't remember. "

532
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,355
When are you gonna go public?

533
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,837
Probably in a week.
They' re still strategizing.

534
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,396
-A Iive interview on the networks?
-Y eah.

535
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,473
Jim Lehrer, Tim Russert,
Barbara Walters...

536
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,116
...you, somebody,
the president sitting in a den?

537
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,356
-Y eah.
-Followed by a Iive conference.

538
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,353
They' re working on the strategy.

539
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,116
" I regret that I concealed
my condition from the public.

540
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,472
I regret the appearance that I tried
to deceive voters to win. "

541
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,949
Yes.

542
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,594
And if we don't make it
a big thing, they won't?

543
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,037
Mrs. Bartlet, I'm not sure you have
an appropriate appreciation...

544
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,437
...of the size of what happens next.

545
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,072
-When are you going public?
-Probably in about a week.

546
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,914
-A week? How?
-We're deciding.

547
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,675
Probably a Iive interview
followed by a press conference.

548
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,871
So we need to know
what we'retalking about.

549
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,671
Joey, we need you
to put a poll in the field.

550
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,591
You've gotta come up with a model
that gets us the answers we need...

551
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,678
...without asking the questions
we can't ask.

552
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,553
You've gotta come up
with the model by yourself.

553
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,751
You've gotta break down
the results yourself.

554
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,750
Not even the callers can understand
the questions they' re asking.

555
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,394
And you've got to do it all
in 96 hours.

556
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,310
Is what I'm describing possible?

557
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,433
-We make it a governor.
-A governor.

558
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,117
Of an industrial state.

559
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,591
I didn't....

560
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,949
-The governor of an industrial state.
-Michigan.

561
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,988
And you give him
a degenerative illness?

562
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,639
Joey, you understand that before this
is over, we'reprobably all gonna be...

563
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,593
...spending some time
in front of a grand jury.

564
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,757
-You can do this?
-No problem.

565
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,238
Los Angeles passengers preboarding
flight 12 1 7, please use gate....

566
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,032
That's your flight.

567
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,037
-Josh?
-Y eah.

568
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,789
-How is the president?
-He's fine.

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,796
He's fine.

570
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,513
I'II tell him you asked.

571
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,790
-Ninety-six hours?
-Y eah.

572
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,628
I have to go work now.

573
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,115
The Chinese Embassy won't admit
it's their satellite.

574
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,278
We know it's their satellite.
We've been Iooking at it for years.

575
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,471
It's Iike knowing Mars is Mars.

576
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,272
T ell me you didn't
call the Chinese Embassy.

577
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,313
I didn't call the embassy,
people called the embassy.

578
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,556
-It's not Iike this isn't cause for concern.
-Right.

579
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,797
The Chinese news aren't reporting it
because they won't admit it.

580
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,831
Why do you think the American news
isn't reporting it?

581
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,429
-That's a fascinating question to me.
-T o all of us.

582
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,234
-We don't know what kind of satellite.
-It could be anything.

583
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,475
-Communications.
-Right.

584
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,796
-It could be a spy satellite.
-It could have plutonium.

585
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,638
That's right.

586
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,833
-PIutonium?
-Y eah.

587
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,435
-PIutonium.
-Well, nuclear reactors on a satellite...

588
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,198
...aren't common,
but you never know.

589
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,957
No, I suppose you don't.

590
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,515
-Hey, Donna.
-Good evening, ma'am, welcome back.

591
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,392
-Thank you.
-How was the trip?

592
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,750
-I got a helicopter named after me.
-Mrs. Bartlet.

593
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,678
Hello. How are you?

594
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,472
I'm fine, but there's a giant object...

595
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,148
... hurling its way toward us
at a devastating velocity.

596
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,351
T ell me about it.

597
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,350
-C.J.?
-Good evening, ma'am.

598
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,875
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

599
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,357
How was your day?

600
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,632
I got bitch-slapped by the White House
counsel. How about you?

601
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,993
I wanted to be here
when you were told.

602
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,832
I didn't know they were
gonna tell you Iast night.

603
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,159
You know, Leo called me
into the Oval Office about 1 1 :00...

604
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,830
...and I was standing
with Toby when Leo called me in.

605
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,190
And Toby said:

606
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,989
" I'II be right here in my office
when you' re done. "

607
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,110
I didn't know what he meant
or why he said it.

608
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,953
Yeah.

609
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,714
Babish said there's a difference
between asking the president:

610
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,151
" Is there anything I should know? "
and " Is there anything I need to know? "

611
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,352
He seemed to think " need to know "
implies I know something already...

612
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,151
... but I don't want it confirmed
in order to maintain...

613
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,712
...deniability.

614
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,755
Well, he's a Iawyer, C.J.
He's vetting, it's his job.

615
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,193
I told him I couldn't remember
which one I say.

616
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,398
There were a Iot of things
I couldn't remember.

617
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,911
Abbey...

618
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,312
...during the campaign we were
in Manhattan, Kansas at a Sheraton...

619
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,479
...or a Marriott. I can't remember,
but we were in Manhattan, Kansas.

620
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,430
I came to your suite early to tell you
we'd be doing Nightline that night...

621
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,916
...and we had to get
to an ABC affiliate.

622
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,720
And I think by then the two of you
were so used to people...

623
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,435
...walking in and out of your room
that you didn't hear me open the door.

624
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,429
And I was almost sure I saw you...

625
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,473
...giving the president
an injection of something.

626
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,796
It was Betaseron.

627
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,596
It reduces the frequency of the attacks.

628
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,195
When the president has his physical
and I do the release...

629
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,790
... I only ever ask
" Is there anything else I need to know? "

630
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,477
Come on in.

631
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,394
-She's in.
-What's she gonna do?

632
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,359
" If the governor of a major
state had a degenerative illness...

633
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,710
...which he hadn't disclosed
but which has yet...

634
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,229
...to impair his performance,
would you support him? "

635
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,311
-Which governor?
-Michigan.

636
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,758
Well...

637
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,753
...then we'II wait.

638
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,912
Y eah.

639
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,915
Listen, about this Justice appropriation--

640
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,151
-You're gonna do a report?
-Y eah.

641
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,039
Then can I read the report
before you ask me to green-Iight...

642
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,516
...another multi-million dollar battle
that'II have no support in Congress?

643
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,159
Y eah.

644
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,398
I just brought it up because
this assistant A.G., Martin Connelly...

645
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,479
...when he Ieft my office this morning,
he turned and said:

646
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,592
"They perpetrated a fraud
against the public. "

647
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,874
And the Iook on his face
when he said it....

648
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,757
They want to get these people.

649
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,277
We're not big tobacco.

650
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,551
Yeah.

651
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,470
-He's expecting me.
-Okay.

652
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,433
Good evening, Mr. President.

653
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,475
Leo, how could you tell Abbey
about the health form before I did?

654
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,910
I didn't know you hadn't told her.

655
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,078
My wife and I are fighting battles
on several fronts at the moment...

656
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,555
...including one with each other.
Can you and I be men?

657
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,910
Can we have a bond?

658
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,078
-We're putting a poll in the field.
-How?

659
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,192
We're using a woman Josh and Toby
trust named Joey Lucas.

660
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,634
I met Joey Lucas.

661
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,799
She's basically giving MS
to the governor of Michigan.

662
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,315
-How's he gonna feel about that?
-Don't worry.

663
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,633
-This is a bad idea.
-We've gotta do it.

664
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,757
I'm coming clean.
I'm doing it voluntarily.

665
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,758
It's gonna Iook Iike I did it
because a poll told me to.

666
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,356
Then it'd be a good idea
if nobody found out.

667
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,716
AII right.

668
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,836
Why don't you get Sam?

669
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,951
-So.
-Y eah.

670
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,038
-I think I may have offended--
-Oh, God.

671
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,912
-Yeah.
-Who?

672
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,559
I met with some of the staffers...

673
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,035
...for Americans for T ax Justice
and the Progressive Caucus.

674
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,955
-You think you may have offended them?
-Y eah. And girls, possibly.

675
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,791
-Were you right?
-Y eah. Toby, it's class--

676
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,076
That's all you need to tell me.
I trust you.

677
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,469
-Sam?
-Y eah.

678
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,716
-Come see the president, would you?
-Y eah.

679
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,239
-Sam?
-Y eah.

680
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,040
I'II be here in the office
when you' re done.

681
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,631
Y eah, okay.

682
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,516
-C.J.
-Hey.

683
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,109
-You walking?
-Yeah.

684
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,832
-I met with Joey Lucas today.
-I heard.

685
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,157
The president's got Leo worried
it's gonna Iook Iike we announced it...

686
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,831
... because we took a poll.
What do you think?

687
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,398
What?

688
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,599
The president and Leo
are worried about that?

689
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,553
Y eah. What?

690
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,710
You guys are Iike
Butch and Sundance...

691
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,912
... peering over a cliff to the
boulder-filled rapids 300 feet below...

692
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,669
...thinking you better not jump because
there's a chance you might drown.

693
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,277
The president has this disease
and has been Iying about it...

694
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
...and you guys are worried
that the polling might make us Iook bad?

695
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,232
It's the fall that's gonna kill you.

696
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,834
-Us.
-What?

697
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,473
You said, " It's the fall that's gonna
kill you. " You meant us.

698
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,553
-Where are you going, C.J.?
-Home. I know what you meant.

699
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,354
I want to sleep for a while.
I'm going home.

700
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,435
You know, Donna got hold of this fax...

701
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,154
...that was sent to the Press Office
from the OSF at NASA.

702
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,430
-What, something falling out of the sky?
-Y eah.

703
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,518
-We get that fax once a week.
-Y eah, but Donna doe'sn't know that.

704
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,429
-She thinks it's an emergency.
-And you didn't want to tell her?

705
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,872
No, the other way you get a day of
entertainment without Ieaving the office.

706
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,795
She doe'sn't know that these things
fall out of the sky all the time.

707
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,151
Once every 1 0 days,
as a matter of fact.

708
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,749
Since the first year we started
putting objects in space...

709
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,316
... 1 7,000 have come back.
Remarkably, not one person has been hit.

710
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,599
So I suppose there's an argument
to be made that we'redue.

711
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,832
Yeah, you picked me
right up there, Josh.

712
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,955
-See you tomorrow.
-Y eah.

713
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:33,955
