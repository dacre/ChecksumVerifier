00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,398
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,598
Five U.S. DEA agents
have been abducted in Colombia.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,912
The government has no control
over the region. There is no Iaw.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,833
And they' re gonna shoot them
in the head and have a parade.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,310
In three hours I want to
kick in the back door.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,233
-When do I see numbers?
-There's a 1 7 percent response rate.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,869
-When do I see numbers?
-In five minutes.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,512
It may take a Iittle Ionger now.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,239
-You mad at me?
-We had a deal.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,959
When did you decide you were gonna
run for a second term?

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,469
Mr. President.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,953
It was just three hours ago
I gave the State of the Union.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,957
-Y eah.
-You believe that?

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,430
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,596
I'm not allowed
to smoke inside anymore.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,712
I thought you were allowed to do
pretty much whatever you want.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,795
Up to the point where you accidentally
burn holes in priceless antiques.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,036
-You should stop smoking.
-Why?

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,879
-You'II Iive Ionger.
-I smoke two cigarettes a day.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,709
-It's a bad example.
-For who, Russian spy satellites?

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,469
George Bernard Shaw said, "You don't
Iive Ionger. It just seems Ionger. "

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,557
I'm not sure it was Shaw.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,713
I'm not sure it was either.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,110
-Is it time?
-Y eah.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,554
T en hut!

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,828
Where are we?

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,477
Sir, a C-1 41 with two Delta Force
teams has been in the air for 85 minutes.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,990
-What happens when I give the order?
-They'II enter Colombian airspace.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,351
At the same time, a 1 9-man unit,
a Special Forces AIpha team...

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,996
...that's already on the ground at
T res Encinas, will head to Villacerreno.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,792
What do they do when they get there?

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,634
They'II hike 1 1 miles
into the jungle and hold still.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,836
-Why?
-It'II be daylight by then.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,958
Nineteen guys have to Iie
face-down in the jungle till sunset?

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,832
That's when the hostages will be moved.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,992
-And that's when we go.
-They' re moving the hostages where?

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,998
From the T asco outpost
to the Frente command center.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,559
-On foot?
-Y eah.

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,998
1 0. 7 kilometers down the road,
there's a plateau called Mesa Del Oro.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,350
That'II give the Deltas
maximum maneuverability.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,750
-The code name's Cassiopeia?
-Y es, sir.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,150
Mickey, you Iook Iike
you wanna say something.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,511
-Mr. President, I think you should wait.
-For what?

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,751
T o see how negotiations
continue with Guerra.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,389
Guerra wants Aguilar
out of a Colombian prison.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,070
Are there any other circumstances under
which he'II give these hostages back?

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,799
-Possibly.
-Crap.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,350
If we keep talking, we don't risk
hostages getting shot in the rescue.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,673
What difference doe's it make if they' re
shot during a rescue or at Villacerreno?

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,480
We can keep them alive Ionger
if we Iet them be taken there.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,712
Are we gonna keep them alive Ionger
or will it just seem Ionger?

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,029
Sir?

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,595
I've reason to believe
they'II be tortured at Villacerreno.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,872
They' re U S. drug agents. They know
things these people wanna know.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,871
Sir, the C-1 41 is approaching
Colombian airspace.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,475
Go.

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,157
Tonight's State of the Union
contained 8747 words.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,631
It was second in length
only to his inaugural address...

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,549
...and 75 minutes longer than
Washington 's first address to Congress.

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,070
Officer SIoan, would you be willing
to go on television tomorrow?

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,033
-They knew how many words there were.
-In the speech?

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,952
-About 8700?
-Y eah.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,119
-Would you be willing to go on TV?
-I think I'd really rather just go home.

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,318
This is gonna be a part of the news
by tomorrow night either way.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,515
How do you know?

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,029
Same way I knew there were
8700 words in the speech.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,111
I have some experience at this.

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,118
-What'II happen?
-You'II do a very quick satellite interview.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,629
"What was it Iike being
at the State of the Union? "

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,875
" It was an honor. "

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,950
"T alk about your act of heroism. "
" I wouldn't really call it heroism, but.... "

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,197
" Now, I understand you had
some trouble back in the early '80s. "

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,436
" I'm glad I have a chance
to talk about that. "

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,677
And you tell your story
just Iike you told it to me.

75
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,114
-Do I wear my uniform?
-Coat and tie.

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,719
Carol?

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,555
Would you make sure Officer SIoan
gets back to his hotel?

78
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,996
I'd like to thank all our guests tonight.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,671
Henry Shallick, David Satch, Toby
Ziegler, Bob Woodward, Jeff Greenfield...

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,631
... C.J. Cregg and of course, the White
House for allowing us to broadcast Iive.

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,469
You've been watching a special
expanded edition of Capitol Beat.

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,036
I'm Mark Gottfried. Have a good night.

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,599
We're out.

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,957
Great job, everybody.

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,637
-You said 20 minutes.
-I was in a meeting.

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,319
-It's now 40.
-I was in a meeting.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,476
-At midnight?
-It's not midnight everywhere.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,398
-What's his story?
-He's innocent.

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,669
You just decided?

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,997
A grand jury, a DA and a civil court
judge decided 1 7 years ago.

91
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,714
Nobody brought charges,
and the civil suit was dismissed.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,315
-Then why on his record--?
-Detroit police cited him...

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,795
...for excessive force to calm
the black community.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
It was a robbery. They were
jumping over walls.

95
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,840
The guy's Ieg was already fractured
when SIoan got there.

96
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,189
He's gonna do your show.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,431
-Is he doing everybody else's show too?
-No.

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,393
-Why not?
-Because you waited 40 minutes.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,228
Hey.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,955
Bill Dryer from Gillette's office called.
He wants to have a meeting with you.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,230
-Dryer?
-Gillette.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,040
-I'II bet he wants a meeting with me.
-Y eah.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,990
It's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,232
We got enough input from him
while we were writing the thing.

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,237
-I don't need to hear--
-He's very upset.

106
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,000
-I know, he's--
-More than we calculated.

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,474
We've upset him.

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,636
We have to Iearn
to Iive with that pain.

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,068
He's not the president.

110
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,033
He's a junior senator from
North Dakota where nobody Iives...

111
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,913
... because it's cold and they
don't have a sports franchise.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,951
Do I need to Iay out
why he is important?

113
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,752
-No.
-He is adored by the Ieft.

114
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,997
-Stop Iaying out the ways.
-He's our Iink to the environmentalists.

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,636
Toby, asking for this meeting
isn't out of Iine, and you should take it.

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,798
In fact, you should take it tomorrow
morning at 7:30 at the Hyatt.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,275
-You set it up already?
-Just the time and place.

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,234
-You expect me to explain myself to him?
-Y es. Y es, I do.

119
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,359
-Fine.
-Toby.

120
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,915
-C.J.
-7:30.

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,550
The Post is calling it "sleek,
challenging and oftentimes witty. "

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,034
Not unlike myself.

123
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,470
Who is SIoan and why
am I just hearing about this?

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,272
SIoan was one of the invited guests.

125
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,550
The one we stuck in over the weekend?

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,957
A Iong time ago he was cited by
the Detroit police for excessive force.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,037
-Against a black suspect?
-Y eah.

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,312
-How was this guy not vetted?
-Because it was Iast minute.

129
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,353
-What are you doing about it?
-Gottfried's gonna interview him.

130
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,391
-It's a bad idea.
-Why?

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,068
BIacks won't react well
to our supporting a brutal cop.

132
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,157
-He's not a brutal cop.
-Says you.

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,830
Says me, a grand jury, two judges,
the district attorney and common sense.

134
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,112
It's going public anyway, Toby.
Gottfried got the story on his own.

135
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,437
-Fine. Where's Josh?
-He went back to the phone banks.

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,398
-Is the electricity back on?
-No.

137
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,558
-Then what's he doing there?
-Hoping the electricity goes on.

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,112
Well, that ought to do it.

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,791
-Josh?
-Y eah?

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,918
-Can I tell you something about women?
-Oh, God, please don't.

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,718
-We Iike to be wooed.
-Donna.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,036
-She wants you to ask her out.
-She doe'sn't.

143
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,918
-You're missing the signs.
-I'm not.

144
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,390
-I know a thing or two about Iove.
-No, you don't.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,556
-The signs.
-I'm thinking of firing you.

146
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,190
-You've fired me twice. I'm impervious.
-Among other things.

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,629
-We'II start over tomorrow night.
-Why?

148
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,799
It's already 9:30 in California. The power
isn't on. We're missing half the window.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,230
-Joey.
-Pack it in.

150
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,154
Okay. Folks, we'II start over
tomorrow night.

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,991
-See you.
-Take it easy.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,633
Good night.

153
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,078
So you have to wait another day.

154
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,874
-I'm not good at waiting.
-No kidding.

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,035
Donna.

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,038
Why do you expect our polling
to be any different than others?

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,437
We've got dial groups. We've got
CNN, USA Today. We've got Gallup.

158
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,791
-Why's our poll gonna be different?
-We're asking different questions.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,513
I'II get your coat.

160
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,479
By the way...

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,235
... right there, back when
she said, "See you"...

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,158
-...that was a sign.
-You're fired.

163
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,271
-Impervious.
-Y eah.

164
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,791
-Mr. President?
-Yeah.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,954
You understand
we've got heating inside, right?

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,191
This isn't cold. It's crisp.

167
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,391
No, it's cold.

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,716
Well, you' re a big wussy.

169
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,792
-Knight to king-4.
-It'II Ieave the bishop open.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,468
You're gonna sacrifice
the bishop for the queen's rook.

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,188
-Where?
-Four moves down.

172
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,557
Abbey's pretty pissed at me.

173
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,955
-How bad?
-Pretty bad.

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,191
King's knight-3.

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,798
I have this image in my mind of the dead
soldiers coming back from Vietnam...

176
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,112
...the caskets coming off the plane,
but I don't know from where.

177
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,915
-T elevision.
-The caskets coming off the plane?

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,234
Are they down?

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,432
Y eah, the Deltas Ianded in T res Encinas.

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,950
AIpha moved out, and they'II be
in Villacerreno at 0700.

181
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,156
Where they wait.

182
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,079
Yeah.

183
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,311
I'II see you in the morning.

184
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,556
Thank you, Mr. President.

185
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,630
-Morning, Charlie.
-Morning, Mrs. Landingham.

186
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,195
-Did you ever solve the mystery?
-Of the $500 check?

187
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,389
-Y eah.
-Y es, I did.

188
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,158
-I solved the mystery.
-What was it?

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,238
-I'm a mystery solver.
-That's wonderful, sweetie. What was it?

190
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,034
Mrs. Bartlet wrote the check
to a woman she read about...

191
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,117
...who's now Iiving in a women's shelter.

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,117
You know why
she never cashed the check?

193
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,312
Because it was from the First Lady,
and she had it framed instead?

194
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,272
-That was the mystery.
-It's a good one.

195
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,153
Doe's the president know he has
breakfast with Josh and Sam?

196
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,669
He's on his way.
It was a good mystery.

197
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,758
You solved it fast because I Ioosened
the ketchup bottle for you.

198
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,598
-Okay.
-Okay.

199
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,395
-Can I tell you something strange?
-Sure.

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,591
AII Iast night at the phone banks...

201
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,473
... Donna was telling me
I should ask Joey Lucas out.

202
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,318
You should.

203
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,069
Fine. But that aside, what do you make
of Donna being the one pushing it?

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,192
-I don't make anything.
-You wouldn't think she'd be jealous?

205
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,231
She goes out with guys. Are you jealous?

206
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,395
-No.
-See?

207
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,437
-I don't get jealous.
-So?

208
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,997
I don't Iike it, and usually do everything
within my capabilities to sabotage it...

209
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,559
...which is why it's curious that Donna
would do nothing to discourage...

210
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,638
...in fact do everything to encourage,
a date with Joey Lucas...

211
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,115
...who, quite frankly,
is a very attractive woman.

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,634
-Josh?
-Y eah.

213
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,276
-Your voice got really high at the end.
-Y eah, sorry.

214
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,198
-Hey.
-Good morning, sir.

215
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,038
Thanks for having breakfast with me.

216
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,117
-Did you order?
-We were waiting for you.

217
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,477
-Billy. You want scrambled eggs?
-Y eah, thanks.

218
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,878
-Can we get them some scrambled eggs?
-Anything for you?

219
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,917
-I'm fine.
-Then we'refine too.

220
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,798
-No.
-Sir, we'refine.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,195
-Bring them some food. Would you?
-Yes, sir.

222
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,273
You understand I can't discuss
with you any rescue mission...

223
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,914
...that may or may not be
in play right now.

224
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,519
Of course.

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,398
I'm assuming State has people
negotiating with Nelson Guerra.

226
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,434
Nelson Guerra wants me to tell President
Santos to release Aguilar from prison.

227
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,716
I wouldn't make that call
with a gun to my head.

228
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,952
I have a gun to my head,
and I'm not making that phone call.

229
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,793
I inherited "War on Drugs"...

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,594
...from a president, who inherited it
from a president...

231
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,189
...who inherited it from
a president before that.

232
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,350
I'm not 100% sure who we'refighting,
but I know we'renot winning.

233
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,717
T en years ago, we spent $5 billion
fighting drugs...

234
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,151
...and we did such a good job
that Iast year we spent 1 6 billion.

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,195
Sixty percent of federal prisoners
are in jail on drug charges...

236
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,109
...as opposed to two and a half percent
that are there for violent crime.

237
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,352
We imprison a higher percentage
of our citizens than Russia did...

238
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,915
... under Communism
and South Africa under apartheid.

239
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,835
Somewhere between 50 and 85 percent
of the prison population...

240
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,235
... has a drug or alcohol abuse problem.

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,631
We've tried "Just Say No. "
I don't think it's gonna work.

242
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,918
I'm mentioning this...

243
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,669
... because I'd Iike you to give me any
thoughts you might have on the subject.

244
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,075
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Thank you, sir.

245
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,358
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

246
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,788
-I came in early.
-Bonnie.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,319
I've been here for an hour.

248
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,750
Are we releasing the names
of the agents or not?

249
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,109
Y eah.

250
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,356
-You gotta give me another chance.
-At what?

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,313
-At meeting the president.
-You met the president Iast night.

252
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,590
-I was wearing a bathrobe.
-You sat in paint.

253
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,109
-I was singing and dancing.
-You were happy.

254
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,471
-I threw my drink up in the air.
-Not much of it Ianded on your head.

255
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,632
-I Iooked Iike an idiot, and it's your fault.
-My fault?

256
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,155
You arranged the meeting
over my express wishes.

257
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,079
I'm not the one who got you
jumping around Iike Joey Heatherton.

258
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,475
-Do something.
-Arrange another introduction?

259
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,154
-You have to.
-Last night you were scared to meet him.

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,349
And I'm still scared...

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,068
... but I'II overcome that
to erase the humiliation...

262
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,430
... I've brought upon myself
and my father.

263
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,831
You're just in your own Iittle Euripides
play over there, aren't you?

264
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,837
PIease arrange another introduction.

265
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,155
-Fine.
-Really?

266
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,271
-Y es.
-Thank you.

267
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,559
You should've given me a heads up
on the BIue Ribbon, Toby.

268
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,910
-Seth.
-You should've given me a heads up.

269
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,680
It happened five minutes before
he walked into the House.

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,793
You're a junior senator and don't get
script approval on the State of the Union.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,629
Whatever Ianguage you couched it in,
it was not an insignificant change.

272
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,714
You started off with, "We will not cut
Social Security, " and wound up with:

273
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,230
"We're announcing the formation of
a bipartisan BIue Ribbon Commission...

274
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,835
...to study options
with regard to Social Security. "

275
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,439
What is the danger in that?

276
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,716
What's the danger in my reform bill?

277
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,349
Diverting revenue into
trust funds is not reform.

278
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,071
It's the only Social Security reform bill
supported by any Senate Democrats.

279
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,555
-How many votes did it get Iast year?
-The White House--

280
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,435
Eighteen. Eighty-two U.S. senators
think your reform bill sucks.

281
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,152
So unless you can pick up a majority...

282
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,352
... I don't know what's wrong
with being open to hearing new ideas.

283
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,068
And compromise essential
Democratic Party principles...

284
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,352
-...to cut a deal with the Republicans?
-It's not what we'redoing.

285
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,597
If your commission recommends
raising the retirement age one day...

286
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,638
... reducing benefits one dollar,
reducing COLAs....

287
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,513
If you recommend partial
privatization on Social Security...

288
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,675
Are there cameras?

289
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,350
... I will condemn it as an act
intent on destroying Social Security.

290
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,750
-And ruling the galaxy.
-You think this is a joke?

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,958
You think I won't publicly condemn
a member of my party?

292
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,833
The president's not a member
of your party. He's the Ieader.

293
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,191
If you think demonizing people
who are trying to govern responsibly...

294
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,311
...is the way to protect
our Iiberal base...

295
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,637
...then speaking as a Iiberal,
go to bed. Would you, please?

296
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,911
You're running to the right
on the environment.

297
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,270
We admonished environmental terrorism.
You're in favor of it?

298
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,317
It was cheap, and you Iost friends.

299
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,755
-We made more than we Iost.
-Then you go on TV...

300
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,838
...in defense of a cop who
kicked the crap out of a black kid...

301
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,469
... because you don't want
to admit you screwed up...

302
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,989
...and he never should've been invited.

303
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,269
Seniors, environmentalists,
African-Americans.

304
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,949
T ell me which has a greater
chance of happening:

305
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,718
My reform bill getting passed...

306
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,878
...or the president getting reelected
without these three groups.

307
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,270
Three groups that will never
desert the president.

308
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,637
Not unless I run
as a third-party candidate, no.

309
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,954
Those 1 8 votes are Iooking a Iittle bigger
now. Aren't they, you son of a bitch?

310
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,993
I was just thinking about
this cartoon I once saw.

311
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,634
Tiny fish are swimming through
the Ieaves of a plant.

312
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,831
But then one fish realizes
it's not a plant.

313
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,998
It's the tentacles of a predator.
And the fish says:

314
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,515
"With friends Iike this,
who needs anemones? "

315
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,876
Come at us from the Ieft,
and I'm gonna own your ass.

316
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,873
Ask someone at my office
for the notes on the noon speech.

317
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,712
-"Women in the Arts"?
-Y eah.

318
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,190
-And pack a sweater for the plane?
-Y eah.

319
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,994
-Hey, Charlie.
-Good morning, ma'am. You heading out?

320
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,356
Not till tonight. Chicago, then Seattle.

321
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,190
I wanted your permission to draw $500
and walk it to that woman in the shelter.

322
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,274
-Oh, I'd appreciate that. Thank you.
-Is there anything else I can do?

323
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,112
Thank you, ma'am.

324
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,000
-Hey.
-Good morning, sir. I'II be in the office.

325
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,589
What's that about?

326
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,995
Charlie's gonna bring cash over
to Jane Robinson.

327
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,196
-You're packing already?
-Y eah.

328
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,960
-You're not Ieaving till tonight, right?
-Y eah.

329
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,308
Men and women are completely
different in this regard.

330
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,915
When was the Iast time
you packed a suitcase at all?

331
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,439
I don't know.

332
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,916
I just had breakfast
with Sam and Josh.

333
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,111
Toby's having breakfast
with Seth Gillette...

334
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,834
...who's every bit as pissed
at me as you are.

335
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,149
-Abbey, can we...?
-Guys, can you give me a minute?

336
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,157
We didn't get a chance
to talk Iast night.

337
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,799
-I don't think we should.
-T alk?

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,877
-Ever?
-Oh, if wishing made it so, Jed.

339
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,475
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to talk now.

340
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,352
-Why?
-You've gotta focus on Colombia.

341
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,874
I can do two things at once.

342
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,588
You don't have two things at once.
You have 92 things.

343
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,677
One of them is five hostages in Colombia.

344
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,718
And I'd Iike to go on without
this black cloud around me...

345
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,148
...so I'd Iike to talk now.

346
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,271
This is a Ionger conversation than that...

347
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,790
...and we can talk about it Iater.
And you should focus.

348
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,077
What are you, my Zen master?
Can I be in charge of my own mind?

349
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,429
Let me tell you something!

350
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,194
Get as chippy as you want
if that makes you feel better.

351
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,313
I am your wife. I Iove you. You have
a crisis. You have to deal with it.

352
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,199
When it's done, we'II talk.

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,515
I feel better already.

354
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,318
I'm on hold.

355
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,471
I'm on hold.

356
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,313
I'm on hold.

357
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,719
I'm in some hellish
hold world of holding.

358
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,548
-Josh?
-I'm on hold.

359
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,432
They'II call us when the
power's back.

360
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,999
-They did.
-What happened?

361
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,679
I'm on hold.

362
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,754
-I'II wait with you.
-That'II be a Iot of fun.

363
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,113
So you never told me
why this poll is different...

364
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,550
...why you' re interested
in these particular numbers.

365
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,228
There are five congressional
districts that concern me.

366
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,755
-Which districts?
-Kentucky 3rd. That's Louisville.

367
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,355
-And Jefferson.
-Y eah. Louisiana 4th, Missouri 9th...

368
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,313
-... Missouri 6th and Ohio 1 2th.
-What's with those districts?

369
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,432
The president announced
a crime package that would--

370
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,272
Require a five-day background check.

371
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,114
-Those congressmen--
-Are sitting on the fence.

372
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,039
So you wanna know how
the package polled in those districts.

373
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,798
If it polled well, you got your gun Iaw.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,514
If it tanked, you shut up
or Iose five seats in the House.

375
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,878
Why do you ask when you' re gonna
have the conversation all by yourself?

376
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,034
-You want me to hold the phone?
-I can hold the phone.

377
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,553
Take the phone. Give me the phone.

378
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,630
Why are you trying to fix me up
with Joey Lucas?

379
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,757
I think you'd make a nice couple.

380
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,075
Fine.

381
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,636
If you got married, you wouldn't have
to get your towels re-monogrammed.

382
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,869
Thank you.

383
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,469
-The power's back on.
-Excellent.

384
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,318
-What do we do now?
-We wait.

385
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,274
How you doing, Ainsley?

386
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,869
My mouth is dry, my hands
are moist and I have to pee.

387
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,035
Okay.

388
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,435
-Hey, you ready?
-Y es.

389
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,959
You sure? Let's go.

390
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,229
-Call it off.
-Here we go.

391
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,395
-No, really.
-Ainsley.

392
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,238
-I'II meet him another time.
-What other time?

393
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,714
-A better time.
-What's a better time?

394
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,875
T omorrow.

395
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,594
Don't you have to absolve yourself
of the humiliation...

396
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,030
...visited on your family
and the House of Atreus?

397
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,595
But I believe I'm going to
compound the humiliation.

398
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,028
-It'II never happen.
-Really?

399
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,719
No, it probably will.

400
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,192
-Hey.
-Is he coming?

401
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,756
He's stopping in on his way
from the thing.

402
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,554
How you doing, Ainsley?

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,870
I'm concerned about peeing
on your carpet.

404
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,039
-Okay, well, now I am too.
-T ell her it's gonna be fine.

405
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,115
-Your skirt's on backwards.
-May I use the bathroom?

406
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,197
-Y es.
-Thank you.

407
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,513
Ainsley!

408
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,237
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Is she here?

409
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,556
-Ainsley Hayes? Y es, sir.
-Where is she?

410
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,791
Well, she's in the closet, Mr. President.

411
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,756
-Why?
-She thought it was a bathroom.

412
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,993
-Why is she still in there?
-That's kind of hard to say, sir.

413
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,714
-Why don't we get her out here?
-Y eah.

414
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,432
-Ainsley?
-Y es?

415
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,108
Ainsley, why don't you
come on out of there?

416
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,878
How you doing?

417
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,958
We met Iast night. You were singing
and dancing in a bathrobe.

418
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,878
-Y es, sir.
-Why were you in the closet?

419
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,109
I had to pee.

420
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,999
I can't smoke inside,
but you can pee in Leo's closet.

421
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,834
-Mr. President--
-I appreciate your coming to work for me.

422
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,476
You're an exceptionally bright young
woman. Is your father proud of you?

423
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,991
-Y es, sir.
-I'II bet he is.

424
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,231
-Listen....
-Mr. President.

425
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,879
Sam.

426
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,038
What happened?

427
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,717
Charlie, get the door.

428
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,509
What happened?

429
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,990
-Mr. President--
-Did we Iose the hostages?

430
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
-The hostages weren't there.
-What are you talking about?

431
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,949
-Oh, God.
-What?

432
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,670
The radio communications we'd been
intercepting on the SIGINT were wrong.

433
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,997
When the Deltas got to the area,
it was a dry hole.

434
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,835
That's when one of the two
BIackhawk helicopters...

435
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,715
...was shot down by a shoulder-
mounted surface-to-air missile.

436
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,833
-How many guys were on the BIackhawk?
-The pilot, the engineer and seven Deltas.

437
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,079
So I've got nine more guys now
on the ground we've gotta get back?

438
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,749
Mr. President.

439
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,834
Sir, the second BIackhawk went in
and recovered the bodies.

440
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,876
-They' re dead?
-Y es, sir.

441
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,435
I want the president of Colombia on
the phone. I want a translator right now.

442
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,199
Damn it!

443
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,112
Damn it!

444
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,075
Sir?

445
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,236
How the hell did that happen?

446
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
-It was bad intelligence.
-You think?

447
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,229
Frente Ieft behind a radio
and a soldier at the outpost...

448
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,829
...and they were deliberately
sending misinformation.

449
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,709
We'd never anticipated the possibility
that somebody might try that?

450
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,629
We weren't prepared for someone
to try and outfox us with a stratagem...

451
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,877
...so sophisticated
it's an entire generation beyond :

452
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,150
" Hey, Iook, your shoelaces are untied! "

453
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,435
Is that how I just Iost nine guys,
to a damn street gang with a ham radio?

454
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,553
They Iured us there so that
they could kill nine American soldiers!

455
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,477
-Where are the bodies?
-They' re on their way back.

456
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,472
-Where?
-Dover. Around 4 a. m.

457
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,470
Mr. President?

458
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,311
We have a secure connection.

459
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,432
-Somebody translating on the other end?
-Y es, sir.

460
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,798
Mr. President, this is
the president of the United States.

461
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,115
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Mr. President.

462
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,869
Ninety minutes ago, the United States
invaded Colombian airspace.

463
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,635
Two BIackhawk helicopters
went into T res Encinas...

464
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,035
...with 20 Delta commandos
on intelligence...

465
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,430
...that the hostages were being moved.

466
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,430
One of the BIackhawks was shot down.
There were nine military fatalities.

467
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,631
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

468
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,394
I'd Iike to ask for your assistance
in confirming...

469
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,637
...that the five hostages are still alive.

470
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,956
The hostages are alive.

471
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,955
-How doe's he know that?
-How do you know that?

472
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,789
We have confirmation that we' re
transmitting to you through channels.

473
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,112
-Mr. President?
-Y es.

474
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,794
I respect and appreciate
your diplomacy...

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,912
...in not yet asking me to release
Juan Aguilar from prison.

476
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,879
I'm not going to ask you, Miguel.

477
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,869
I'm willing to do it at this point.

478
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,355
Say that again?

479
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,398
I'm willing to Iet Aguilar out in exchange
for the hostages, if you ask me to.

480
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,596
I appreciate your making that offer,
but I don't think that's a very good idea.

481
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,476
I agree with you, but I'm making
the offer, and I'm Ieaving it up to you.

482
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,518
Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.

483
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,870
Thank you, Mr. President.

484
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,192
-Wait, Toby.
-Not a second, Sam.

485
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,954
You give into terrorist demands
and that's the ballgame.

486
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,718
But there are real Iives at stake.

487
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,388
It's easy to stick to principle
if nothing's at stake.

488
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,068
Let's argue about principles
after these guys get home.

489
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,029
Juan Aguilar runs one of the
Iargest drug cartels in the world.

490
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,358
He has produced $1 5 billion worth
of cocaine in two years.

491
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,836
He's murdered or ordered the murder
of eight Supreme Court justices...

492
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,312
...a pro-extradition prime minister and
three federal police officers in Bogotá.

493
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,590
And from his prison cell,
I guarantee you...

494
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,435
... he orchestrated the kidnapping
of five U S. DEA agents...

495
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,677
-...and the killing of their rescuers.
-I believe he did as well...

496
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,839
...which is evidence that it couldn't
matter Iess whether he's in prison or not.

497
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,548
I'II share a cell with him
before I Iet him out.

498
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,791
-I want military options.
-Yes, sir.

499
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,918
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,309
-Y eah.
-Joey says probably just another hour.

501
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,590
-She'II bring the numbers here?
-Y eah.

502
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,273
-Josh, how is this not a no-brainer?
-Colombia?

503
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,156
-You say get them home?
-Of course. Who doe'sn't?

504
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,874
That should be the person
who has to call the families.

505
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,548
And who calls the families
of the commandos who died...

506
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,553
...trying to save five guys
we could've freed hours ago?

507
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,677
-That's not a good enough reason.
-The reason is...

508
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,798
...you give in, and it gives them
incentive to keep terrorizing.

509
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,070
Not negotiating hasn't given
them disincentive.

510
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,389
-How do you know?
-PIease.

511
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,114
You don't think they' re gonna
kidnap more people...

512
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,675
-...and demand free cable?
-So give them free cable.

513
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,110
How about the keys
to the Situation Room?

514
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,314
-You draw a Iine.
-Where?

515
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,717
-She said an hour?
-On the early numbers?

516
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,194
-Y eah.
-Y eah.

517
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,591
Do we know where they are?

518
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,953
They were moved about 60 miles
into the jungle at Villacerreno.

519
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,430
-What would it take to get them back?
-AIive?

520
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,908
Yeah.

521
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,275
-Mr. President--
-What would it take to wipe them out?

522
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,875
-The Frente?
-Y eah.

523
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,834
What would it take?

524
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,600
For the kind of victory
Americans are used to...

525
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,836
...for the kind of victory
Americans demand...

526
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,712
...you need a 1 0-to-1 ratio.

527
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,076
It was only after that ratio in the Gulf...

528
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,157
...that we felt comfortable
making a move.

529
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,920
Frente has 20,000 well-armed,
well-trained soldiers...

530
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,078
...each of whom has a financial
stake in heroin and cocaine.

531
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,909
We need to put 200 to 300,000
men into a jungle war...

532
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,913
-...and I think we'd Iose as many as half.
-Half.

533
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,714
Y es, sir.

534
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,238
You gotta ask yourself, "What's the point
in being a superpower anymore? "

535
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,199
-I wanted to bring that book.
-The T ruman biography.

536
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,277
-You got a sweater for the plane?
-Y es, ma'am.

537
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,152
And you should both take sweaters.

538
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,874
-And then there's the repacking.
-Mr. President.

539
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,834
First, the preliminary, or the dry run.
Then there's the actual packing.

540
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,477
You're just going away
for two days, right?

541
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,033
Guys.

542
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,549
Right?

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,159
What happened?

544
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,358
-It was an ambush.
-Oh, God.

545
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,269
A guy with a shoulder thing shot
down a BIackhawk. Everybody's dead.

546
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,513
Nine guys.

547
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,112
Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages
60 miles into the jungle...

548
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,271
...where we'd need tweezers
to get them.

549
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,590
You want me to stay?

550
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,153
-No.
-I can stay.

551
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,553
No.

552
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,709
I didn't make the decision to run again.
I wouldn't do that without you.

553
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,076
-We don't need to talk about that now.
-When?

554
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,430
-Jed.
-I didn't make the decision to run again.

555
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,916
Y es, you did. If we'regonna talk
about this, Iet's talk about this.

556
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,510
The moves over the Iast few weeks,
the changes in Iast night's speech.

557
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,676
This whole place is in reelection mode.

558
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,514
That's what we do, Abbey.
We run for things.

559
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,076
From the day a congressman is sworn in,
he's gotta raise $ 1 0,000 a week...

560
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,474
...so he can get reelected.

561
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,955
A president gets to govern
for 1 8 months.

562
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,355
We try to get people to vote for us...

563
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,949
...and we hope the people
force us to do good things.

564
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,431
-We had a deal.
-Y es, we had a deal.

565
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,472
Y es, Jed.

566
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,119
Look at me.

567
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,076
-Do you get that you have MS?
-Abbey.

568
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,477
Do you get that your own immune
system is shredding your brain...

569
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,676
...and I can't tell you why?

570
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,033
Do you have any idea
how good a doctor I am...

571
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,550
-...and that I can't tell you why?
-I've had one episode in two years.

572
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,796
Y es, but relapsing/remitting MS...

573
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,349
...can turn into secondary/
progressive MS...

574
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,398
...oftentimes ten years
after the initial diagnosis...

575
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,756
...which is where we'II be
in two years.

576
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,672
Do you know what that will Iook Iike?

577
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,552
-I know what it's gonna....
-Fatigue...

578
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,314
-...an inability to get through the day...
-Look--

579
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,273
... memory Iapses,
Ioss of cognitive function...

580
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,393
...failure to reason, to think clearly.
I can't tell you if it's gonna happen.

581
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,837
I don't know if it's gonna get better
or if it's gonna get worse.

582
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,599
But we had a deal.

583
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,470
And that deal was how you justified
keeping it a secret from the world.

584
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,236
It's how you justified it to God.

585
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,195
It's how you justified it to me.

586
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,068
-Mrs. Bartlet?
-Yeah.

587
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,079
You sure you don't want me to stay?

588
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,593
Y eah.

589
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,312
Okay.

590
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,352
Have a good trip.

591
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,476
Call me when you get there.

592
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,114
I will.

593
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,752
I Iove you.

594
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,951
I Iove you too.

595
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,879
-Son of a bitch.
-I'm sorry.

596
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,390
A person can't wait five days
to buy a gun?

597
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,431
If someone needs a gun right now...

598
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,710
...isn't that something
to be concerned about?

599
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,275
T aking the feelings
of gun owners into account...

600
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,519
...if you've gotta shoot somebody, it
probably isn't something that can wait.

601
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,558
You mind if I take off?

602
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,997
-What time is it?
-2 a. m.

603
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,869
AII right, we'II call that a full day,
but come in early tomorrow.

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,070
-You're all right getting home?
-Y eah.

605
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,396
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

606
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,111
-They' re just preliminary numbers.
-They' re not gonna change.

607
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,594
No.

608
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,911
A five-day waiting period.

609
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,990
-It tested well nationwide.
-Y eah.

610
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,394
Fifty-eight percent.

611
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,074
I didn't need nationwide.
I needed those districts.

612
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,794
We'II have to dial down
the gun rhetoric in the Midwest.

613
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,758
Why not dial it up?

614
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,672
Because these numbers just told us--

615
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,150
You don't know
what these numbers just told you.

616
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,794
I don't know what these numbers
just told you.

617
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,598
We know.

618
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,394
-Really?
-Numbers don't Iie.

619
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,559
They Iie all the time.

620
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,749
They Iie when 72% of Americans
say they' re tired of a sex scandal...

621
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,351
...while all the while, newspaper
circulation goes through the roof...

622
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,835
...for anyone featuring the story.

623
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,311
If you polled a hundred Donnas...

624
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,829
...and asked them
if they think we should go out...

625
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,110
...you'd get a high positive response.

626
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,279
But the poll wouldn't tell you...

627
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,197
...it's because she Iikes you
and she knows it's beginning to show...

628
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,079
...and she needs to cover herself
with misdirection.

629
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,200
Believe me when I tell you
that's not true.

630
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,119
You say that these numbers
mean dial it down.

631
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,073
I say they mean dial it up.
You haven't gotten through.

632
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,350
There are people
you haven't persuaded yet.

633
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,591
These numbers mean dial it up.

634
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,229
Otherwise, you' re Iike
the French radical...

635
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,000
...watching a crowd run by and saying :

636
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,838
"There go my people.

637
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,073
I must find out where they' re going
so I can Iead them. "

638
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,794
Yeah.

639
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,199
We'II go through the rest
of the numbers in the morning.

640
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,879
Okay.

641
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,950
-Good evening, sir.
-Hey, Charlie.

642
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,277
You shouldn't be out here
without a coat.

643
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,799
I'm okay.

644
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,076
-Mr. President?
-Y eah.

645
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,869
-Is there anything I can do for you?
-No. Thanks.

646
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,673
Hey.

647
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,669
I checked outside. I thought
you'd be having a cigarette.

648
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,237
Let me tell you something, Leo. After
heroin and cocaine, tobacco is next.

649
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,591
Great, another criminal empire
we can give birth to.

650
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,035
There'II be speakeasies
all over Chicago...

651
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,835
...where you can get smuggled
cartons of Marlboro Lights.

652
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,352
I fought a jungle war.
I'm not doing it again.

653
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,159
If I could put myself anywhere in time...

654
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,309
...it would be the Cabinet Room
on August 4th, 1 964...

655
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,989
...when our ships were attacked
by North Vietnam in the T onkin Gulf.

656
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,518
I'd say:

657
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,399
" Mr. President, don't do it.

658
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,229
You're considering authorizing
a massive commitment of troops...

659
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,876
...and throwing in our Iot
with torturers and panderers...

660
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,675
...Ieaders without principle
and soldiers without conviction...

661
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,077
...with no clear mission
and no end in sight. "

662
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,072
This war's at home.

663
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,790
Its casualties are in our prisons
and not our hospitals.

664
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,191
The amount of money the American
government is spending in Colombia...

665
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,198
...is the exact same amount
American consumers are spending...

666
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,551
... buying drugs from Colombia.
We're funding both sides of this war.

667
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,830
And we'II never win it that way.

668
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,313
-Leo, I can't possibly reverse--
-No one--

669
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,512
I can't possibly reverse
our position on negotiating with--

670
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,352
No one's gonna know.

671
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,549
You don't make another phone call.
That happens someplace else.

672
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,196
Santos is gonna be the one
to Iet him out.

673
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,638
There were just 1 4 people in the room
who heard Santos make me the offer.

674
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,634
Those 1 4 people keep
bigger secrets than this.

675
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,078
You know what T ruman Capote said was
the bad part about Iiving outside the Iaw?

676
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,429
What?

677
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,029
You no Ionger have the protection of it.

678
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,677
What's to stop me?

679
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,468
Two hundred CIA operatives.
BIack Ops.

680
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,834
Two hundred guys with no wives,
no kids, no parents.

681
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,911
I send 200 operatives down there.

682
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,669
Monday morning I read in the paper
Juan Aguilar is dead.

683
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,075
What's to stop me?

684
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,193
We Iost this one, Mr. President.

685
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,029
It was bad intelligence,
and we Iost this one.

686
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,230
It was the queen's rook.
That's why I couldn't trade the bishop.

687
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,715
It was over six moves ago.

688
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,356
-Arrange for their immediate release.
-Y es, sir, Mr. President.

689
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,637
If they so much as experience
turbulence on their way out--

690
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,438
Y es, sir.

691
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,036
I want to go to Dover Iater tonight.

692
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,595
-Y es, sir.
-Thank you.

693
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,354
Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,591
Folks, take your seats, please.
The briefing will start now.

695
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,316
Folks, can you take your seats?

696
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,509
Good evening. Thank you
for coming back so Iate.

697
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,111
I want to fill you in on some events that
have taken place in the Iast 24 hours.

698
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,959
There'II be representatives
from the Pentagon...

699
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,550
.. State and Justice Departments
who'II continue with your questions.

700
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,593
Y esterday at approximately
8 p. m. Eastern time...

701
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,109
...five agents from the DEA
were taken hostage...

702
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,397
...in the Putumayo region of Colombia
by members of the Frente--

703
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,392
-Hold your questions.
-Hostages are out.

704
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,795
- There was a demand...
-I'II call their families.

705
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,190
... for the release
of a Colombian prisoner.

706
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,551
President Miguel Santos,
acting on his own authority....
