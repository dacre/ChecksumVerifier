Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,868
You go out with Zoey,
there's gonna be a lot of people...

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,190
... unhappy seeing you
and the president's daughter.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,034
-You're getting death threats.
-Are they white supremacists?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,191
-I know what I'm looking for.
-What happened?

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,513
-It's a gunshot wound. No exit.
-lt didn't hit anything. They'll make sure.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,116
The guy the Secret Service have
in custody is Carl Leroy.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,954
A bullet collapsed your lung.
I'm trying to re-expand it.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,596
He tried to kill the president
because Zoey and I are together?

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,514
Charlie, the president wasn't
the target.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,192
It's called the "Theory of Everything. "

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,473
-The Theory of Everything?
- Yes.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,877
Is it comprehensive?
That was a joke there, pal of mine.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,076
-Lead with this.
-I'm missing the OMB stats.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,873
-They' re coming.
-C.J., lead with this.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,957
-I'm not leading with it.
-Yes, you are.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,359
-Okay.
-So you got it?

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,153
-Sure.
-So you got what you' re saying?

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,670
-Also the EPA.
-The committee isn't out till 3:00.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,678
-Say it for me.
-He's making me crazy.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,155
-I heard that.
-I know how a speakerphone works.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,556
-Say it for me.
-I have to get to the briefing room.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,716
Say it, please.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,709
" Psychics at Caltech and the Fermi
National Accelerator Lab are close to--

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,593
Physicists.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,950
Theoretical physicists at Caltech.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,599
-Not psychics?
-No.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,279
-I should jot that down.
-Please.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,956
If it was psychics I'd lead with it.
T alk to you later, Mi amor.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,629
-The OMB stats.
-Thanks. You can set them down.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,275
Let Josh rant a little
before you hang up the phone.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,509
-C.J.?
-Yes, ma'am.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,311
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is
gonna report the CPl jumped 0.7%.

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,831
It's the biggest one-month increase
since they started tracking in '52.

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,196
Let me say this: The market basket
used to calculate the CPl is antiquated--

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,390
Say outdated.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,148
And doe'sn't include some household
items like computers--

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,113
Where prices are always dropping.
And doe'sn't reflect...

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,040
...technical improvements
like air bags in automobiles...

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,917
...which increase
the price of the car...

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,589
... but provide a greater value
to the consumer. Got it?

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,472
Let's find out.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,311
Mention the underwriting changes for
the Federal Housing Administration.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,636
The networks will want
special coverage.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,115
The adjustments are in
FHA-related lending.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,868
They'll need time to put
together a logo and music.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,192
-The Bureau of Labor Statistics--
-Reported the CPl jumped 0. 7%.

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,629
-Thank you.
-C.J.?

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,956
-Holy interruptus, Batman.
-Grant Samuels died.

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,310
-Really? He's really dead this time?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,034
-Last time you said he was, he wasn't.
-He is this time.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,832
-Somebody poked him to see if--
-He died.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,390
-Then I shouldn't have made a joke.
-I'm almost certain he's dead.

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,910
I was making a joke too.
What, you work alone?

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,594
He's survived by
his wife, Eileen, son, Robert...

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,598
...two daughters
and eight grandchildren.

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,359
-I won't learn their names.
-Fine.

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,153
Eileen, Robert, Priscilla, Patty.

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,556
-I assume it was complications due to...?
-Yeah.

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,319
You know about theoretical physics?

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,909
-The Grand Unified Theory.
-Know anything about it?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,036
-No.
-Okay.

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,875
Folks, please take your seats.
The briefing will start now.

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,153
Good morning. I have to start
with a sad announcement.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,432
Congressman Grant Samuels finally
succumbed to pneumonia.

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,792
His wife, Eileen, his son, Robert,
his daughters Priscilla and Patty...

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,958
...and his eight grandchildren are all
in the president's thoughts.

68
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,913
I also want to talk about
the Bureau of Labor Statistics...

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,077
...and the Federal Housing
Administration.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,717
And as a special treat for Josh Lyman,
who's recovering very nicely at GW...

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,595
...the president's science adviser
is saying that psychics at Caltech...

72
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,189
...and the Fermi National
Accelerator Lab....

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,189
I'm pretty sure that was
supposed to be "physicists. "

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,034
-Eighty-one percent.
-And all we had to do was get shot at.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,873
-81 %.
-Those numbers are soft.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,279
-You think?
-You don't?

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,433
The job approval was at 51. We got
shot at, it's 81. The numbers are soft.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,876
Still, 81 %....

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,435
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning, everybody.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,029
Anybody know what the word
"acalculia" means?

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,157
It's an inability to perform
arithmetic functions.

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,993
Sorry. You wanted to answer that.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,351
-Yeah, but I'll get over it.
-That's mature.

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,954
-Shut up.
-You're not over it?

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,229
-No.
-Okay.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,229
-Did we really poll at 81 %?
-Those are CNN/USA Today.

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,919
-It's soft.
-No.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,157
When asked "Whose approach on
national problems do you think is best...

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,040
... Bartlet or the Republican leaders
of Congress, " Bartlet gets 61 %.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,634
Well, 1 9% of the country has
made up their minds about me.

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,839
20% just feels sorry for me, which
is what you want if you' re president.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,393
-Give us an overview.
-We have a shot to take back the House.

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,715
That and getting two seats
net in the Senate.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,956
And two governorships
and six State Houses.

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,118
-Where should we look?
-lndiana 6th, California 4th and 1 4th.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,152
-Michigan 1 2th.
-T exas 1 2th.

97
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,429
Florida 4, 5 and 9.

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,836
We won't elect
a Democrat in the Florida 9th.

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,514
-Sorry, Florida 8th.
-They won't elect one there either...

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,591
... but let's put some time into it.
What else?

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,118
-I can hold or you can call me back.
-An inability to do arithmetic functions.

102
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,949
Apparently there's a specialized circuit
in the brain for numbers.

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,189
-Know where it is?
-Sorry?

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,391
-It's in the left parietal lobe.
-Thank you.

105
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,477
-Hey, Zoey.
-Hey. Where's Mrs. Landingham?

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,079
A funeral. President's in there.

107
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,952
I'm here to see him, not my father.

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,391
-Do you know what acalculia means?
-Yes, because I got it at breakfast.

109
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,671
-Okay.
-Thank you.

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,870
-Hey.
-Hi.

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,236
Mrs. Landingham asked me
to ask you to call T echnical Support...

112
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,638
...and have them look at her computer.
Ask for Andrew Mackintosh.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,194
-She only trusts him.
-Mackintosh?

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,913
-Like the apple.
-Sure.

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,632
Thank you.

116
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,911
-I called you last night.
-I got home late.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,955
-Where were you?
-Here.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,037
-I called here too.
-I'm not lying to you.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,909
I don't think you're lying. I think you
were here or didn't return my call.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,434
I was here, I got no message.
I was home, I got it.

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,439
-lt was too late to call you.
-I don't mind being woken up.

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,358
Well, now I know that.

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,959
-Now you know that?
-Excuse me.

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,315
We haven't been dating
for nine months?

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,874
I've got to go in there.

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,872
Cumberland, Monroe,
possibly Stanwyck.

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,039
Since you brought them up,
can I say a word about the shooting?

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,037
-The honeymoon's about to be over.
-She's right.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,913
We don't wanna look like we're
taking advantage of the situation.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,713
-Why not?
-Why not what?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,278
The country was a victim of domestic
terrorism. Why not use the numbers...

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,195
... before they disappear and go after
the guns and go after the hate groups?

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,556
-lt doe'sn't look good.
-Looks good to me.

134
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,992
You work for the White House, we were
counting on your support either way.

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,837
For questions about the midterms, say,
"We haven't thought that far ahead. "

136
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,633
And when they ask about
the link between approval numbers...

137
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,839
...and the shooting, the president's
deeply gratified by the public's support...

138
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,428
-...but eager to focus on the issues.
-Which will be?

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,194
I'll let you know.
Thank you very much, everyone.

140
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,238
Thank you, Mr. President.

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,953
Mr. President.

142
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,034
It's fine. Tell him around 3:00.
Was Zoey out there?

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,189
-Yes.
-ls she still here?

144
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,795
-I don't know, sir.
-Okay.

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,197
-Leo?
-Yes, sir?

146
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,552
Did you know Elliot Roush is running
for school board in Manchester?

147
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,638
I didn't, sir, but then I don't know
who Elliot Roush is.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,831
-My Elliot Roush.
-Sorry, sir. I'm still not--

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
I beat him in my first
congressional campaign.

150
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,397
I can't believe I didn't commit
that arcane information to memory.

151
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,318
I want polling numbers on that race.

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,070
I don't want you focusing your attention
on a New Hampshire school board race.

153
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,033
Because looking at two numbers
takes the life out of me.

154
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,748
-I know where this is going.
-Get me the numbers.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,673
I'm ready to go out there.
I don't need to wait another week.

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,918
Sir, let's play a game of "Who Do
You Think I'm Gonna Agree With? "

157
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,431
1 4 doctors say you should wait a week
before assuming a campaign schedule.

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,869
Who will I agree with?

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,116
-Get away from me.
-Yes, sir.

160
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,040
Sam?

161
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,110
-ls he here?
-Want me to bring him back?

162
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,197
I'll go get him myself.

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,038
-T om?
-Sam.

164
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,040
-Hello.
-Hope you weren't waiting long.

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,396
No. I mean, I don't mind.
Sam, this is my wife, Sarah.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,119
-Hi.
-It's nice to meet you.

167
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,994
-You got married.
-Two years, with a baby on the way.

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,515
-ls it his?
-Yeah.

169
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,400
-Okay. Follow me.
-Okay.

170
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,478
Tom and I had a professor at Duke
who couldn't stand me.

171
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,593
"Those may be your thoughts,
Mr. Seaborn, but that's not the law. "

172
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,189
I wanted to tell him
to take the law and shove it up--

173
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,072
-You ever been in the White House?
-No.

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,397
-We were looking forward to a tour.
-That's my office over there...

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,956
...the president works in that round room
there and no one else matters.

176
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,678
Come on in.

177
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,833
-This is the Mural Room.
-Can you tell us anything about it?

178
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,593
It's called the Mural Room. Have a seat.

179
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,913
-You know why I wanted to talk to you?
-I really don't.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,993
Because the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee asked me to.

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,794
-Grant Samuels died a few days ago.
-We saw on the news.

182
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,877
He wasn't gonna run again
because he was sick...

183
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,037
...and the man who'd run in his place--

184
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,554
-Seymour Wirthin?
-Right. Isn't going to.

185
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,795
He's not running?

186
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,152
You're a phenomenally attractive
Democratic candidate for that district.

187
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,430
There are 1 62 games in a baseball
season and the players have a saying:

188
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,998
" Every team wins and loses 54 games.
It's the other 54 games that count. "

189
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,439
In your district,
the other 54 games are women.

190
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,996
Specifically, young mothers, among
whom the number one issue is crime.

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,111
You're a graduate of Oberlin
and Duke Law.

192
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,113
You passed up lucrative opportunities
to work for the D.A.

193
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,389
You're a prosecutor with
an exceptional conviction record...

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,948
...and nobody can say you' re soft
on crime. You're active in local politics.

195
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,677
You are personable.
You are articulate and energetic.

196
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,871
You are married
and you are having a baby.

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,791
-I thought you didn't know that.
-Sorry?

198
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,914
Out there, it seemed like you didn't know
he was married with a baby coming...

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,191
...and now it sounded like
you already knew that.

200
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,313
Sarah, there's very little information
about him I don't have.

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,875
And tell your mom
happy birthday for me.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,468
You'll have the weight of the
Democratic National Committee...

203
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,194
...the Congressional Campaign
Committee, the minority leader...

204
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,631
...whom we hope to make
the majority leader, and the president.

205
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,388
What do you say?
You wanna run for Congress?

206
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
There's a lot to consider, Sam.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,276
-How much time do I have to consider it?
-Five minutes. I'll be outside.

208
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,274
-You're pissed at me?
-I could've used your support.

209
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,034
I support you like you support me,
when I agree with you...

210
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,919
...or when I don't care what you say.
This time I disagreed.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
We shouldn't use this to get aggressive
about guns and hate groups?

212
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,874
We were victims of a crime and
it's unseemly to use this moment at all.

213
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,431
We're not taking advantage of anyone!
And even if we were, who cares?

214
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,996
Every Republican trying for the next
1 2 weeks to keep control of the House.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,874
Toby, if you and the FBl
wanna go after hate groups...

216
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,754
... I'm not the one you have to convince.
Bag the president.

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,399
I will.

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,431
I've gotten calls about pieces
people wanna do...

219
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,439
...on how staffers are handling
the shooting and the aftermath.

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,914
-Psychologically?
-Yeah.

221
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,390
-It's not a good idea.
-We're not the story.

222
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,995
That's what I'm saying.

223
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,237
Leave me alone.

224
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,072
I've got it.

225
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,033
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,678
Bonnie. Ginger. I've got it.

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,871
-Excellent.
-Way to go.

228
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,473
Sam?

229
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,552
Sam?

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,799
-Sam?
-Right here.

231
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,957
-I thought you were in there.
-I wasn't.

232
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,473
-I've got it.
-Got what?

233
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,150
How to avoid the appearance that we're
randomly going after extremist groups...

234
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,910
-...in violation of their civil liberties.
-We can avoid that by not doing it.

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,754
Yes, or with this: the shooting was the
action of not one, but at least three...

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,116
...card-carrying members
of West Virginia White Pride.

237
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,594
-They have cards?
-What?

238
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,031
-They have membership cards?
-Who the hell knows? It's an expression.

239
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,034
The key phrase is "at least. "
At least three members.

240
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,556
-There might be more.
-So the FBl has grounds to investigate--

241
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes, to investigate the activities
of all extremist organizations.

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,917
Under a cover
of investigating this crime.

243
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,875
How do we know that Young Nazis
of Delaware weren't coconspirators?

244
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,030
It's a common way
to get around the Bill of Rights.

245
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,751
-I'm surprised it took you so long.
-I had no help from anyone else.

246
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,438
-I'm taking it to Leo.
-Go ahead.

247
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,039
-Donna?
-Yes?

248
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,951
-You going to see Josh?
-I'm taking him lunch.

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,912
-Can I come?
-No.

250
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,879
-You know the rules.
-They're dumb.

251
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,393
-They are not dumb.
-Seriously--

252
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,069
I'm serious. He's recovering
from an attempted murder...

253
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,238
...he's supposed to rest. I don't want
people getting him fartusht.

254
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,431
Don't bring the Yiddish.

255
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,870
You know what word
should be Yiddish? Spatula.

256
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,037
-Also "far-fetched. "
-I need to talk about--

257
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,190
How to bring the hate crimes
to the president.

258
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,869
He's got the papers you wrote
and materials you sent.

259
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,919
-You talk on the phone 93 times a day.
-I'd like to talk to him at his apartment.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,069
-No.
-Donna.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,396
Maybe if you hadn't said
the rules were dumb.

262
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,954
Yeah.

263
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,190
-Hey, Leo.
-Hey, kid.

264
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,875
-I was looking for my dad.
-He's making campaign calls.

265
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,594
-He's not in the office.
-He's doing it from the residence.

266
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,559
-Why?
-Your father has a strict interpretation...

267
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,196
...of something called the Pendleton Act,
which prohibits campaign donations...

268
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,550
...to be solicited
on government property.

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,355
It's a little impractical for the president
to use a pay phone, isn't it?

270
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,949
-Exactly.
-lsn't the residence government property?

271
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,389
-Yes.
-Then why...?

272
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,793
Because your father is a demented,
demented man. I'm going over there.

273
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,879
-Leo, do you feel like Charlie's--?
-No.

274
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,878
-Sir--
-Forty-six percent.

275
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,435
-Yes, sir.
-The guy is polling at 46%.

276
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,076
I didn't think they had data on people
running for the board of education.

277
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,470
They don't.
I had to have our guys do it.

278
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,876
Sir, do you think you're obsessed
with this race?

279
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,875
He's polling at 46%. He's not a joke.
He's polling inside the margin.

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,992
In a race in a school district
that has 43 kids.

281
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,590
It has 1 100 kids. And you don't take
these people seriously...

282
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,871
...because they don't
get anywhere nationally.

283
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,071
All they have to do is,
bit by little bit...

284
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,039
...get onto boards of education
and city councils.

285
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,032
That's where all the governing
that matters really happens.

286
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,590
-We do some governing here.
-I'm on hold with a guy whose name...

287
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,668
... I've got on an index card. How much
governing is going on around here today?

288
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,599
-And can you believe I'm on hold?
-You finished the call.

289
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,229
-I did?
-Yes, sir.

290
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,158
-How'd it go?
-Very well.

291
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,799
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.

292
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,150
How do you know?
You had our people check.

293
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,590
I have three daughters
who grew up there.

294
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,236
-Leave him alone. You beat him already.
-And he has come back.

295
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,036
Like crabgrass pulled from the lawn.
Not by the root, but by the other thing.

296
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,474
-I wanted to see how the calls are going.
-They' re going fine.

297
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,434
-Then I'll leave.
-Can't tell you how much I'll miss you.

298
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,196
-You wanted to talk to me?
-Not if you're in this mood.

299
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,593
This is real.

300
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,671
A man who makes the Spanish lnquisition
look like a Barbara Walters special...

301
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,633
...is now polling at 46%
in your school district...

302
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,559
...for which I have personally
baked things to raise money.

303
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,159
-You can go too.
-You baked things?

304
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,879
-You can go.
-Thank you.

305
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,033
-What do you want?
-Dad, listen. Do you think Charlie...?

306
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,352
The calls are going well. We're still
getting asked to do aftermath stories.

307
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,232
-Psychological effects?
-Yeah. I was--

308
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,556
-Don't do it.
-No, I know. I was wondering--

309
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,353
You were wondering what?

310
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,310
-This won't be good.
-You were wondering what?

311
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,909
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

312
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,869
Hey, it's C.J. Cregg.

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,798
Step three: public disclosure
of membership...

314
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,709
...and contributor rolls for all
organizations on the list of hate groups.

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
This allows the public to know
who these people are...

316
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,159
...and where their funding is from.

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,398
And to do it in violation
of their right to free association.

318
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,274
Laws like that were passed
during the civil rights movement...

319
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,956
...to root out members of such terrorist
organizations as the NAACP.

320
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,834
The Supreme Court said those laws
were unconstitutional.

321
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,110
That was a Warren Court
that struck those down.

322
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,868
-They'd see it differently today.
-You're an ultra-activist.

323
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,152
And I was shot at,
and so I'm acting right now.

324
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,999
Sam?

325
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,838
He wants everyone
to register affiliation with the FBl.

326
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,032
-Any First Amendment problems?
-I'll get around them.

327
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,315
I need to talk to you.

328
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,670
-What's up?
-There's a problem with your friend.

329
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,359
-Which friend?
-T om Jordan.

330
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,232
-What's wrong?
-His prosecutorial record.

331
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,308
-His prosecutorial record is great.
-Not during jury selection.

332
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,189
Preemptive challenges?

333
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,914
Your friend likes white juries
for black defendants.

334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,873
-He's a prosecutor.
-Not now. Now he's a politician...

335
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,357
-...and this needs a save, so get into it.
-Yeah.

336
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,152
-How did T okyo open?
-I think up 3/8, but let me check again.

337
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,158
-ls that it for me?
-You've got phone calls still to make.

338
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,117
Wengland?
Frank Gates and MacNamara?

339
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,112
-Yes, sir.
-Those are campaign calls.

340
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,874
Why don't you just stay in your office
and make the damn--?

341
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,833
Because I choose not to, Charlie.

342
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,878
Because however
an empty gesture it may seem...

343
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,039
... I would like to take notice
of the notion that it's not a good idea...

344
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,588
...for the most powerful person
in the world...

345
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,589
...to be calling up the people whose laws
he signs and asking them for money!

346
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,473
I'm gonna do it, but not behind
this desk. Not in this room. What else?

347
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,708
I was asked to tell you that an event
was added for T uesday the 7th.

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,037
A reception for talk radio....
Hosts, I guess they' re called.

349
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,918
It's three weeks away.
You don't need to commit right now.

350
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,798
Yeah.

351
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,798
I'll make these calls from the residence.

352
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,594
-T ell C.J. I wanna see her in an hour.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,228
Hello.

354
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,315
Are you a Cabinet secretary?

355
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,430
-Can you tell me your name?
-Jeffrey.

356
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,075
-Jeffrey what?
-Jeffrey Mackintosh.

357
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,911
-Like the apple?
-Yeah.

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,877
You're here with your dad?

359
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,868
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

360
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,350
When I tell you to sit and stay put,
you know what I need you to do?

361
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,957
That. I need you to do that.
Not some variation on that, but that.

362
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,919
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

363
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,159
Okay, see, now I got to make you
rewire the house.

364
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,751
I'm Andrew Mackintosh
from T echnical Support.

365
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,956
-I'm installing--
-I thought that was weeks ago.

366
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,310
-lt was, but there were some bugs.
-Okay.

367
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,115
They said it was okay to bring my son.
My wife works nights.

368
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,436
-Sure.
-Let's go, big man.

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,553
-Take it easy, Jeffrey.
-Take it easy.

370
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,031
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

371
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,636
-Leo?
-Sam, come in. Close the door.

372
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,439
-What's up?
-Josh is on speaker.

373
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,153
-Hey, Sam.
-What's going on?

374
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,149
A guy who went to college with T om
says he was in an all-white fraternity.

375
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,159
-The papers are carrying it tomorrow.
-I checked that weeks ago.

376
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,196
It wasn't an exclusive fraternity,
they just didn't have any black pledges.

377
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,313
It's common to have
black fraternities and white fraternities.

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,871
But you put this together with the
preemptive challenges in voir dire...

379
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,913
...and leaders in African-American
communities have a problem.

380
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,315
-I'll talk to them.
-No, it's over, Sam.

381
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,438
I'm gonna cancel the president's stop
and shut down the money.

382
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,438
-You can't cut and run.
-There's no choice.

383
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,911
-We have a choice.
-We've got a chance at the House.

384
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,708
Leo must put the president
and money where it can win.

385
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,275
-T om Jordan is running against a man--
-Don't tell me.

386
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,955
-We'll hand it to him.
-lt won't matter if we get the House.

387
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,477
Jordan is down by seven
and he's not gonna come back from this.

388
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,910
And if we stand by him,
this is a national thing.

389
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,636
It could drag down black turnout
in districts where we'recompetitive.

390
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,831
-I told him....
-Yeah.

391
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,511
I told him we would stand behind him.

392
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,957
I told him he'd have
our full support.

393
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,873
-I was asked to ask him to run.
-I know.

394
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,597
We walk away now, that's it.
He's a racist.

395
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,030
The White House just said so.

396
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,114
We can't afford all the things
we want, Sam. It's over.

397
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,597
Hey, Leo. You know, there 's something
called the "Superstring Theory"...

398
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,913
...which says that the universe
consists of these tiny loops of string...

399
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,911
...that vibrate at different frequencies.

400
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,318
How did that bullet not kill you?

401
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,078
-Just lucky, I guess.
-Yeah.

402
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,397
-Toby?
-Yeah.

403
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,679
Any chance I can see an advance copy of
the president's remarks for Asia-Pacific?

404
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,114
-What?
-Asia-Pacific?

405
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,918
I have a draft here. I'm gonna rewrite it.

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,879
-I thought I'd have it by today.
-Day's not over.

407
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,309
These pieces everyone wants to do
on the aftermath of the shooting...

408
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,153
...they've had me thinking.

409
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,951
Do you think there is a psychological
aftermath we'renot paying attention to?

410
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,157
-I don't have time for this conversation.
-You should have this conversation.

411
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,235
-You think my problem is psychological?
-You've been ignoring responsibilities...

412
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,114
-That's crap.
-...so you can act like the FBl director.

413
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,874
I'm waiting for the director of the FBl
to behave that way.

414
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,476
I'm waiting for the Justice Department
and Congress to behave that way.

415
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,990
I'm waiting for the White House
to behave that way!

416
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,917
Wanna lock up everybody
with a white sheet?

417
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,518
Yes, I do. Who has a problem with that?
Bring them to me right now. Yes, I do.

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,153
-He's ready for me?
-ln the residence.

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,919
Thank you.

420
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,835
I'll be here for a while, so whenever
you can get me Asia-Pacific....

421
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,916
Give me an hour.

422
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,759
Come in.

423
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,758
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Hi, C.J.

424
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,354
-Charlie said you wanted to see me.
-Yeah.

425
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,551
Why has there been no press mention...

426
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,389
...of the fact that Elliot Roush was
an opponent of mine in New Hampshire?

427
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,273
-Elliot Roush is the man--
-He's running in Manchester.

428
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,910
-I'm sure it's gotten some local coverage.
-Why isn't it more than local?

429
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,310
-It's a school board seat.
-It's a human interest story.

430
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,790
Not a very interesting one.

431
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,390
I'm saying if anyone in the press room
wanted to do this story...

432
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,109
...that I would comment on-the-record.

433
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,393
Sir....

434
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,391
The president can't publicly take sides
in a local school board election.

435
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,712
-Why can't he?
-Because it's not done.

436
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,310
And it's not fair. It's personal.

437
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,955
And it's irresponsible.
It will galvanize Republicans.

438
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,750
Democrats will think you don't
care about winning back the House.

439
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,834
I don't care about winning back
the House! I don't!

440
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,953
Well, I don't believe that's true...

441
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,231
...so let's just keep that
between you and me.

442
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,238
C.J....

443
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,589
I've known men of faith in my life.
Towering men.

444
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,838
Men of wisdom and compassion.
Men of all faiths.

445
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,072
Of healing and peace. Pro-choice.
Pro-life. Republican. Democrat.

446
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,397
Men and women of God.

447
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,514
Elliot Roush...

448
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,873
...is polling at 53%.
He's polling at 53%.

449
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,151
He's the front-runner.

450
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,035
Then that's the way it is.

451
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,917
In a democracy,
oftentimes other people win.

452
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,913
Yeah.

453
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,116
It was just a thought.

454
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,875
-But, I mean, obviously you're right.
-Yes, sir.

455
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,474
Thanks.

456
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,990
Thank you, Mr. President.

457
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,037
-Ginger?
-They're still too close to call.

458
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,269
-All 1 2?
-Yes.

459
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,399
Get me somebody in the Midwest.
I wanna see everybody on telephones.

460
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,918
Okay, good. Just like that.

461
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,910
God. T om, Sarah.

462
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,513
I'm sorry, I forgot I was....

463
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,037
-I'm sorry. I'm glad you could make it.
-lt was no problem coming, Sam.

464
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,357
Turns out there was really no reason
for us to stay in our district.

465
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,234
Yeah. You've seen the exits.
You're gonna lose, T om.

466
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,636
-No kidding.
-Probably 58-42.

467
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,951
-Yeah.
-42% is a very respectable number.

468
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,391
-The district's 49% Democrat, Sam.
-Well, we'll get them next time.

469
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,030
Shut up. There's not gonna be
a next time, so shut up.

470
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,515
Not even a word
from the White House.

471
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,752
-Not even a word.
-That's how we do it.

472
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,039
Sam?

473
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,349
Any time we have the opportunity
in the future to screw you...

474
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,116
...count on getting screwed.

475
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,676
Good luck with the baby.

476
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,595
No, that was K- TALK
out of Minneapolis.

477
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,115
You're thinking of SLAM-100
in the Great Lakes area.

478
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,472
-The number one station.
-But then it was classic rock.

479
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,638
Or what our program director thought
was classic rock. Fleetwood Mac.

480
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,040
Then they switched over to
news and information back in.... '82?

481
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,031
-'82, '83.
-We started with drive time...

482
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,033
-...then went to the four-hour format.
-ls Howard showing up?

483
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,635
-Stern?
-I heard he would if lmus was coming.

484
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,672
And lmus wasn't showing up
if Howard was.

485
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,356
By the way, I was Dave in the Morning
before he was lmus in the Morning...

486
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,916
-...but that's water under the bridge.
-lsn't Don lmus in his 70s?

487
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,669
I believe so, yes.

488
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,349
How were you
Dave in the Morning first?

489
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,113
It's very painful.

490
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,469
-I don't like to talk about it.
-Okay.

491
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,038
Fellas, I'm sorry, but it's Election Day
and I need to check in with the polls...

492
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,516
-...and whatnot. Good meeting you.
-Good talking to you, C.J.

493
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,474
-Who's that?
-Jenna Jacobs.

494
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,513
-That's Jenna Jacobs?
-Yeah. She changed her hair.

495
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,115
-What's the latest?
-Twelve races too close to call.

496
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,676
-Thompson, Marinovich....
-I'm gonna go check in.

497
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,878
-Good evening.
-I'm drinking the most fantastic thing...

498
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,878
...I've ever tasted in my life.

499
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,030
Chocolate syrup, cold milk and seltzer.

500
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,556
It sounds terrible, but I don't know
where it's been all my life.

501
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,990
It's called an egg cream.
We invented it in Brooklyn.

502
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,953
-ln Brooklyn?
-Yes, sir.

503
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,038
-Not New England?
-There are good things in this world...

504
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,909
-...not from New England, sir.
-Toby, don't ever say that again.

505
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,189
Yes, sir.

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,909
-What's on your mind?
-Mr. President, I was thinking....

507
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,399
-I was thinking it might--
-You wanna take a leave of absence?

508
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,995
I was thinking I might
need some time off, yes, sir.

509
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,396
That's no problem, Toby.

510
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,955
-Okay.
-It's not a problem at all.

511
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,589
Thank you, sir.

512
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,995
Fifteen minutes.

513
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,913
It's time to get up off the mat, Toby.

514
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,158
What's so wrong with having
the attorney general designate...

515
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,189
... potentially dangerous organizations
that promote violent acts?

516
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,358
I understand it's problematic.
There'd be no judicial review...

517
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,269
...or legislative oversight,
or even, for that matter...

518
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,034
...Iegal finding of fact, but....

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,672
Okay, fine.

520
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,875
Why doe's it feel like this?

521
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,634
I've seen shootings before.

522
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,958
This wasn't a shooting, Toby.
It was a lynching.

523
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,394
They tried to lynch Charlie right in front
of our eyes. Can you believe that?

524
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,153
-What's this?
-Keyhole satellite photographs.

525
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,433
That's the headquarters
for West Virginia White Pride.

526
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,274
It's a diner outside Blacksburg.

527
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,796
Every night for the last 1 2 weeks...

528
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,152
... I've picked up the phone to call
the attorney general to say two words:

529
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,078
"Take them. "

530
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,193
Then I hang up, because I know
it'll be better tomorrow.

531
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,914
And better the day after that.

532
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,909
We saw a lynching, Toby.
That's why it feels like this.

533
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,475
I'm not sure I'll come out
the other side of this.

534
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,070
I'm not sure I can either.

535
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,794
But until we are sure...

536
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,913
...I think we should keep
coming to work every day.

537
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,876
How's it going
with your school board guy?

538
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,718
He's gonna win.

539
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,032
When you ran against him,
how'd you beat him?

540
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,274
I don't remember.
I've been thinking about it for weeks...

541
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,988
...but I honestly don't remember.

542
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,911
-Excuse me. Good evening.
-Hey, Sam.

543
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,434
I wasn't sure if you'd go
to the talk radio reception.

544
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,837
-I scratched out some remarks for you.
-Let me look at them.

545
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,193
-Toby, go with us to this radio thing.
-Oh, God. Really, sir?

546
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,191
There'll be crab puffs. New England
crab puffs made in New England.

547
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,993
-It's Alaskan crab.
-Sam....

548
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,396
There's Alaskan crab
in this White House?

549
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,551
He would've known the difference.

550
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,997
-Have you tried them?
-l--

551
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,119
Yes, reluctantly. It was clear
in the way I ate the crab puffs...

552
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,311
-...that it was in protest.
-Were they good?

553
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,996
-Extraordinarily good and going fast.
-Let's get there.

554
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,877
-I call myself "Gary with a G. "
-How else would you spell Gary?

555
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,310
No other way. That's what I call myself.

556
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,955
"Gary with a G
talking to you on KADR a. m. "

557
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,954
-Like Liza with a Z.
-Exactly. Hokey? Maybe so.

558
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,954
-But I have 900,000 listeners.
-Would you excuse me?

559
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,794
Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen?

560
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,559
Ladies and gentlemen?

561
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,877
The president of the United States.

562
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,594
Thank you. Thank you very much.

563
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,559
Thanks. I wish I could spend
more than a few minutes with you...

564
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,115
...but the polls don't close
in the East for another hour...

565
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,358
...and there are plenty
of election results still left to falsify.

566
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,874
With so many people participating
in the political and social debate...

567
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,397
...through call-in shows, it's a good idea
to be reminded every once in a while....

568
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,518
It's a good idea to be reminded
of the awesome impact....

569
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,116
The awesome impact....

570
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,555
I'm sorry.
You're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right?

571
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,638
Yes, sir.

572
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,678
-It's good to have you here.
-Thank you.

573
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,913
The awesome impact of the airwaves
and how that translates into...

574
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,356
...the furthering of our national
discussions, but also how it can....

575
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,398
How it can....

576
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,832
Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs,
are you an MD?

577
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,876
-A Ph. D.
-A Ph. D.?

578
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,552
-Yes, sir.
-ln psychology?

579
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,074
-No, sir.
-Theology?

580
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,879
-No.
-Social work?

581
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,672
I have a Ph.D.
in English literature.

582
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,872
I'm asking because on your show
people call in for advice...

583
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,758
...and you go by the name
Dr. Jacobs on your show...

584
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,512
...and I didn't know if your listeners
were confused and assumed...

585
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,799
...you had advanced training in
psychology, theology or health care.

586
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,877
I don't believe they are confused.

587
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,872
Good. I like your show.

588
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,559
I like how you call
homosexuality an abomination.

589
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,670
I don't say homosexuality
is an abomination, the Bible doe's.

590
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,428
-Yes, it doe's. Leviticus.
-1 8:22.

591
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,036
Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you
a few questions while you were here.

592
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,990
I'm interested in selling my daughter into
slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21 :7.

593
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,558
She's a sophomore, speaks ltalian,
always cleared the table when asked.

594
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,593
What would a good price for her be?

595
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,954
While thinking about that,
can I ask another?

596
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,631
My chief of staff, Leo McGarry,
insists on working on the Sabbath.

597
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,913
Exodus 35: 2 clearly says
he should be put to death.

598
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,879
Am I morally obligated to kill him myself
or is it okay to call the police?

599
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,073
Here's one that's important, because
we have a lot of sports fans in this town.

600
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,030
T ouching the skin of a dead pig
makes one unclean. Leviticus 1 1 :7.

601
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,908
If they wear gloves, can the
Washington Redskins still play football?

602
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,719
Can Notre Dame? Can West Point?

603
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,079
Doe's the whole town really have to be
together to stone my brother John...

604
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,033
...for planting different crops
side by side?

605
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,998
Can I burn my mother
in a small family gathering...

606
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,112
...for wearing garments
made from two different threads?

607
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,557
Think about those questions,
would you? One last thing.

608
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,071
While you may be mistaking this
for your monthly meeting...

609
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,989
...of the lgnorant Tight-ass Club, in this
building, when the president stands...

610
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,952
... nobody sits.

611
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,313
Toby?

612
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,837
Yes, Mr. President.

613
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,510
That's how I beat him.

614
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,594
I'm just--

615
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,030
I'm just gonna take that crab puff.

616
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,838
You want one of my animal crackers?

617
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,439
I have...

618
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,836
...elephants and I have lions.

619
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,318
-Are you bugging the man?
-No.

620
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,591
-ls there a software problem?
-I think I got it.

621
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,872
I just want to run a few programs
and then I'll be out of here.

622
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,119
-Pretty busy day around here?
-Yeah.

623
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,874
-My name's Charlie Young.
-I know who you are.

624
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,270
The man who almost
got the president killed?

625
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,954
Yeah. That's gonna look good
on my rsum.

626
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,111
I'll just be a minute.

627
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,030
-My mother used to work nights too.
-I'm sorry?

628
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,959
My mother used to work nights too.

629
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,429
-Was she a nurse?
-A police officer.

630
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,871
Is she gone?

631
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,678
She was shot and killed
in the line a year ago June.

632
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,038
Ironically, she wasn't supposed to be
on the shift.

633
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,113
She switched shifts that day
because I asked her to.

634
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,514
Hey, Charlie, you know what I think
she'd say if she was here right now?

635
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,070
-What?
-The same thing my father would say.

636
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,553
If they' re shooting at you,
you know you' re doing something right.

637
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,199
Yeah.

638
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,033
Yeah.

639
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,148
Yeah.

640
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,594
Excuse me. Aren't you Zoey Bartlet?

641
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,074
It's too much to happen
to someone your age.

642
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,915
Your father. Your mother. And then this.

643
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,952
I don't know....

644
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,310
Charlie, I mean...

645
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,477
...what do you do?

646
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,396
I was gonna go vote.

647
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,839
-I could come.
-Yeah.

648
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,675
-Hi.
-Hi, Leo.

649
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,951
-I'm looking for the president.
-ls anything wrong?

650
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,708
No. I think he may have
done a couple of numbers...

651
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,195
-...at the talk radio reception.
-Okay.

652
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,755
Zoey and I are going out.
I'll be on my pager.

653
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,639
You're going out?
You're taking extra protection, right?

654
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,869
-Hey, Leo, l--
-Secret Service protection, Charlie...

655
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,628
...but thanks for loading me up
with that image.

656
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,558
-We'll have extra protection.
-Okay.

657
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,192
Something about a dead pig's skin.
I need to find him.

658
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,190
Everybody should stay inside
for three months...

659
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,994
...so that they truly appreciate
the outdoors.

660
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,034
I appreciate the outdoors now.
I'm an outdoorsman.

661
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,951
Josh, I said I'd let you outside...

662
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,030
...if you stopped talking about being an
outdoorsman and theoretical physics.

663
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,877
You thought I'd forget about it.
Banner headline, five days ago:

664
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,159
"Model for the Unified Theory Solved. "
Banner headline in The New York Times.

665
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,835
-You said it wasn't news.
-You're wearing my pajamas.

666
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,115
Take your coat off. Let me see.

667
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,076
-Those are too big.
-Yes, they are.

668
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,436
All this time working together,
did you also think...

669
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,109
...I was playing power forward
for the Cleveland Cavaliers?

670
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,910
-I think they look good on you.
-I think you' re both freaks.

671
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,672
-What do you have?
-You won't believe it.

672
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,313
How'd they go?

673
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,119
Twelve races. In none of them
did the incumbent win.

674
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,353
In none did the party
that previously held the seat win.

675
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,671
You know how it went?
7-5.

676
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,593
-You're kidding.
-Seven Republicans, five Democrats?

677
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,831
-Yeah.
-The House stayed the same?

678
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,878
After four months
and $400 million...

679
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,349
-...everything stayed the same?
-Yeah.

680
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,992
T ell me democracy
doe'sn't have a sense of humor.

681
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,679
We sit here, we drink this beer
out here on this stoop...

682
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,875
...in violation of about
47 city ordinances.

683
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,196
I don't know, Toby, it's election night.

684
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,118
What do you say about a government...

685
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,994
...that protects even citizens
that try to destroy it?

686
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,673
God bless America.

687
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,193
God bless America.

688
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,078
-God bless America.
-God bless America.

689
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,952
God bless America.
