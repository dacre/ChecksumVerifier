00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,633
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,911
-I don't know these people.
-You will.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,672
-Which one is Toby?
-I am.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,599
-Which one are you?
-I'm Josh.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,871
-My name is Charlie Young.
-Donna Moss. You?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,791
I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,956
Which one is Josh?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,150
-C.J. Cregg.
-Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,873
-Yeah.
-You gotta be impressed...

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,553
...I got those names right.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,350
-Sam.
-Mark.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,119
-You done?
-Yeah.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,515
-It's not gonna be Wengland.
-What happened?

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,035
-He's stuck in Denver.
-I wanted Wengland.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,954
-Did you get Stackhouse?
-Couldn't get him or Santana, Monroe--

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,349
-Who'd you get?
-A woman named Ainsley Hayes.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,959
-Aimsley?
-Ainsley, with an N.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,315
-I don't know her.
-A new producer brought her in.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,828
-T ell me she's not--
-She is.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,911
-I thought that was over.
-No, it's not.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,037
She's got blond hair, long legs,
she's a Republican, so she's--

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,396
She's in show business.
A young, blond, leggy Republican.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,035
-I thought they didn't know anything.
-They don't.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,519
-Sam.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,709
-Ainsley?
-Yes.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,353
-Mark Gottfried.
-Ainsley Hayes.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,551
We'll be starting here
in about a minute.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,469
-I understand you've never done TV.
-No, not as such. No.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,877
-"Not as such"? What doe's that mean?
-lt means, no, I haven't done TV.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,630
-Can I give you a little friendly advice?
-Yes, I would appreciate it.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,196
-Don't overreach.
-Don't overreach?

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,272
Don't try to do too much,
don't try to know more than you do.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,114
My show is not the place
for you to become a star.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,914
You'll be opposite Sam Seaborn.
He wouldn't keep coming...

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,475
...if he didn't wipe the floor
with everyone.

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,079
-I've seen him.
-Don't be scared.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,590
-I'll try.
-I'll step in, take punches for you...

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,635
...if it gets out of hand, but if you don't
go far from the points, you'll be fine.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,830
Thirty seconds.

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,195
-We start with the education package?
-Yeah.

41
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,153
-You owe me 20 bucks on the Skins.
-ln the Green Room, man.

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,871
-I'm Sam Seaborn.
-Ainsley Hayes.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,435
-Twenty seconds.
-You bet with George on the Skins?

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,119
-Over/under.
-How's Josh?

45
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,469
-He's good.
-Ten seconds.

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,911
-Here we go. Remember what I said.
-Yeah.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,279
In five, four, three....

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,831
Capital Beat, with Mark Gottfried.

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,196
Tonight, from the right, Republican
political analyst Ainsley Hayes.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,950
And from the left, White House
senior advisor Sam Seaborn.

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,919
With Chris Eisen at the Pentagon
and Marjorie Clark in New York.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,389
Good evening. Before we get
to Chris and Marjorie...

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,956
...tonight on the Capital Beat, the
House is expected to vote next week...

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,710
...on President Bartlet's
$ 1. 5-billion education package.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,675
Sam Seaborn, why is this bill better
than its Republican counterpart...

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,877
...that the president
vetoed last year?

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,118
Because it buys things that
teachers need, like textbooks.

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,915
In a fairly comprehensive study,
an alarmingly high number of teachers...

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,038
...40 percent of the teachers
in Kirkwood, Oregon, for instance...

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,875
...and Kirkwood being a fair model for
public school districts in the country...

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,355
...40 percent of teachers
in Kirkwood, Oregon...

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,875
...do not have sufficient
textbooks for students.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,879
The package offered by
the Republican-controlled Congress...

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,873
...offered zero dollars
for new textbooks.

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,315
-Ainsley Hayes, is that true?
-No, it's not.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,033
-ls Sam Seaborn lying?
-" Lying " is an awfully strong word.

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,519
-Do you--?
-Yes, he's lying.

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,751
And we should tell
the truth about education.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,639
-lf you're gonna call--
-The bill had money for textbooks.

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,151
Also, computer literacy,
school safety, physical plant.

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,432
The difference is we wanted
to give the money to communities...

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,188
...and let them decide how
to spend it on the off-chance...

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,914
...the needs of Lincoln High
in Dayton are different from...

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,310
-... Crenshaw High in South Central L.A.
-Why did the president veto the bill?

75
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,878
Because it guaranteed by law that 95%
of the money go into the classroom...

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,197
...and bypass the pork-barrel buffet,
which troubles the president...

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,277
... because he doe'sn't work
for the students.

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,670
-That's untrue.
-He doe'sn't work for the parents.

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,678
He works for the teachers union.

80
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,235
The bill contained plenty
of money for textbooks...

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,591
...and anyone who says
otherwise is lying.

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,599
We should tell the truth about this.
T extbooks are important.

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,916
If for no other reason
than they accurately place...

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,958
... Kirkwood in California, not Oregon.

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,836
And we'rein business. We'll be back
with more Capital Beat after this.

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,069
We're out.

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,590
I'm sorry, did I overreach?

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,876
-Hey, Sam.
-Yeah.

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,111
-This one might know something.
-Yeah.

90
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,153
Please let them not be watching.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,158
Toby. Come quick.
Sam's getting his ass kicked by a girl.

92
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,952
Ginger, get the popcorn.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,998
There'll be a photo op
in a half-hour with President Bartlet...

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,158
...and President Nimbala
of the Republic of Equatorial Kuhndu...

95
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,078
...who's representing African nations.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,591
Is it the goal of the summit to get
drug companies to lower prices...

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,952
...or is the goal to get African
countries to honor U.S. patents?

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,315
The goal of the summit is
to get a step closer...

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,790
...to solving 26 million
African AlDS victims.

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,117
We're counting on the drug companies,
on African nations...

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,790
...on the global health community.
They' re counting on us for a solution.

102
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,196
Will the White House
declare war on drug companies?

103
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,392
It sounds like you have.
If we need a button man, we'll call you.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,636
Thank you.
Half-hour in the Mural Room.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,195
Carol, they'll need to be
in three groups.

106
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,198
You know what you
might have mentioned?

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,152
A 1 4-minute briefing,
and I get reviews?

108
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,876
The same drug that is $1 0 in Norway,
where nobody needs it...

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,315
...costs $90 in Burundi,
where everybody needs it.

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,636
Nothing keeps these
people here but goodwill.

111
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,148
They can charge what they want.

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,715
It sounded like we will
be soft on drug companies.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,275
Nobody expects us
to be anything but tough on...

114
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,875
-...American companies showing a profit.
-Damn right.

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,754
Where was the
' 92 World Copyright Conference?

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,910
-Geneva.
-Thank you.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,276
I really admire the way you came
to work this morning head held high.

118
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,034
I appreciate you being
the only one not to heckle me.

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,749
No problem. There's a bunch of women,
why don't you ask where Geneva is.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,910
Go to my office.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,309
Me and you, 20 questions,
general knowledge test.

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
-Go.
-I'll spot two questions.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,031
-For how much money?
-Go to my office.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,917
I'm going to his office.

125
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,835
-She's making the chicken sound now.
-Go to my office.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,877
A drug they gotta buy
from us for $4...

127
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,435
...they can get generic
from Pakistan for 40 cents.

128
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,872
That's not the only bargain in Pakistan.
My friends and I go for spring fashions.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,757
It shows.

130
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,672
-C.J.
-He made a dig about my clothes.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,313
That'll be with me for the day.

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,956
I wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Bill Kelley from the Cleveland Courier.

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,434
They' re breaking me in...

134
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,671
-...to cover for T om Johnson.
-Welcome.

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,154
Can I ask you something?

136
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,910
Do you know anything about Bonamo
Energy selling drilling equipment to lraq?

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,919
I won't wave you off the story,
but I can't tell you anything.

138
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,590
If they were selling them, that would
be in violation of sanctions, right?

139
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,678
Grand-jury investigations are secret,
I can't tell you any more.

140
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,793
-I understand. Nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you.

141
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,199
-Bill?
-Yeah.

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,309
Nothing, just nothing.

143
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,231
Then you've got guys like Mbeki
who say that AlDS isn't linked to HlV...

144
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,669
...it's linked to poverty.

145
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,190
-lt is.
-Do you want a list of dead millionaires?

146
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,358
He was saying prostitutes,
migrant laborers, the ill-educated...

147
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,029
...and victims of sexual abuse
are more likely--

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,951
Leo, AlDS is caused by HlV.

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,959
You named a group of people
that have a higher mortality rate.

150
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,878
-Morning.
-Good morning, sir.

151
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,598
-Where are we?
-They' re all set.

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,790
Thank you.

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,036
The health minister
was clarifying his comments.

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,556
They have a health minister who
doe'sn't think AlDS is connected to HlV.

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,114
He was clearing up the comments.

156
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,914
Did you see Sam get puréed
last night on Capital Beat?

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,911
I didn't see it,
but I have heard tell.

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,919
He got diced and sliced
by a woman named Ainsley Hayes.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,513
She's been writing some columns.

160
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,876
I had Charlie pull them for me.
Where's she been?

161
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,674
-She was clerking for Dreifort.
-We should hire her.

162
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,757
-That'd be funny.
-No, I mean it.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,036
-Mean what?
-We should hire her.

164
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,633
You mean, as a joke on Sam?

165
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,912
Not as a joke. We should hire
her as a reality. We should hire her.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,956
-She's a Republican.
-So's half the country.

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,150
That half lost, so--

168
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,716
She's smart, not just carping.
She feels a sense of something.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,115
-Of what?
-Mr. President?

170
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,318
Of duty. Of civic duty.

171
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,830
-How many pieces by her did you read?
-Three.

172
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,799
-You're sure of her sense of civic duty?
-I can sense civic duty a mile away.

173
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,274
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,839
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

175
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,433
Good morning, everybody.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,314
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning, sir.

177
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,956
You can tell your caption editors,
Bartlet's the third guy from the right.

178
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,232
Thank you, sir. Presidents Bartlet
and Nimbala will take questions.

179
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,873
-President Bartlet?
-Katie.

180
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,157
This is a summit among leaders
of American pharmaceutical companies...

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,989
...and AlDS-ravaged African nations that
President Nimbala is representing here.

182
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,272
Is there a political upside
to having President Nimbala here...

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,272
...and not the pharmaceutical
companies?

184
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,909
Yes, I'm trying to shore up
the sub-Saharan vote.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,879
Mr. President, are you considering
asking Congress to forgive existing debt?

186
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,350
It's an international health crisis,
there's nothing I'm not considering.

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,676
-Arthur.
-President Nimbala, what's the best...

188
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,794
...you hope to come away with from
this summit? What's a home run?

189
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,355
A miracle.

190
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,955
There are people who
make miracles in the world.

191
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,152
One of them lives right here
in the U.S.

192
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,275
He realized that vital elements could
be harvested from the stalk of the wheat.

193
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,636
In his hands, lndia,
which at the time...

194
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,633
... had been ravaged
by drought and overpopulation...

195
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,708
...in his hands, their wheat crop
increased from 1 1 million tons...

196
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,151
...to 60 million tons annually.

197
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,716
That's right. His name is
Norman Borlaug, by the way...

198
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,192
...and he won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1 970.

199
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,950
Thank you, Mr. President,
President Nimbala. Thank you, everyone.

200
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,194
I think you're absolutely right
about the kind of miracle we need.

201
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,677
I think we're gonna make a lot
of progress in the next couple of days.

202
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,555
I hope so, Mr. President.
My country's dying.

203
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,037
It was called dwarf wheat,
which produces heavy yields...

204
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,998
...without its stalk falling over
from the weight of the grain.

205
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,190
Was it a hybrid?

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,358
What am l, Farmer Bob? There was
more wheat than there used to be.

207
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,550
And hire that girl.

208
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,034
-What girl?
-Ainsley Hayes.

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,432
-No.
-Why?

210
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,915
This is a thing you' re excited
about at breakfast...

211
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,231
...that you forget
you told me to do by lunch.

212
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,158
-Not one of those.
-lt is one of those.

213
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,637
Hard as you might try, the
Republican Party isn't going anywhere.

214
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,275
We don't know that,
they could move to Vancouver.

215
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,919
-I don't think so.
-Me neither.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,197
But being in power means everybody
else can take a seat for four years.

217
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,075
Charlie, I wanna hire a woman whose
voice would fit in nicely around here.

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,033
She's a conservative Republican,
you think I should do it?

219
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,398
Absolutely, Mr. President, because I'm
told that theirs is the party of inclusion.

220
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,912
See? Charlie just made a joke
to you in the Oval Office.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,991
-That's how bad an idea it is.
-Leo--

222
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,193
Seriously, Mr. President, if you wanna
do this, it's not an uninteresting notion...

223
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,118
...just do it in a high-profile place.

224
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,550
-Put a Republican in the Cabinet.
-We might.

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,877
A hundred million Republicans,
we might hire as many as two of them.

226
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,957
-But for now, hire this girl.
-T o do what?

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,959
I don't know. She's a lawyer,
put her in counsel's office.

228
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,634
-You really want me to do this?
-Yes.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,913
-What if she doe'sn't wanna work here?
-Appeal to her sense of duty.

230
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,040
Smooth it over with the staff.
I don't wanna hear from them.

231
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,429
-She can always have my job.
-Yes, she can.

232
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,790
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Thank you.

233
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,876
-Charlie?
-Yes, sir.

234
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,072
When they close the book
on me and you...

235
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
...it will say at this moment,
you were not there for me...

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,997
...and for that there'll be punishment.

237
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,909
Well, you could sing Puccini for me
again, Mr. President. We'll call it even.

238
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,478
--and anyone who says
otherwise is lying.

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,910
-Here it comes.
-Doe's anybody know--?

240
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,315
Textbooks are important.

241
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,034
If for no other reason
than they accurately place...

242
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,953
... Kirkwood in California,
not Oregon.

243
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,356
Oh, I could watch
that a hundred times.

244
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,835
Doe's anybody know
how to work caller lD?

245
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,397
How can you not know
how to use a phone?

246
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,872
-My attention's been elsewhere.
-Pay attention to that because...

247
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,679
-... Bruce's friend is gonna call you.
-The agent?

248
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,394
I don't need an agent,
I need a caller lD tutorial.

249
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,477
You need an agent,
you' re gonna be a star.

250
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,194
Used to be you had to sing and dance.

251
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,836
You are gonna get a lot of work
ripping these people to shreds...

252
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,473
...and looking good doing it.

253
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,955
That's an actual job now?

254
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,910
That's him.

255
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,113
Let's see. I push this button...

256
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,960
...the phone number appears.

257
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,037
Ainsley?

258
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,874
202-456-1 41 4.

259
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,957
Is that the agent?

260
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,838
It's the White House.

261
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,958
-Hey, Sam.
-Excuse me?

262
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,318
-What?
-Did you say something to me?

263
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,319
-I said, " Hey, Sam. "
-Really?

264
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,594
It sounded like you might have made a
wisecrack about Oregon and California.

265
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,393
Sorry. Out of luck.

266
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,910
-Hey, C.J.
-Hi, Donna.

267
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,598
-Just getting here? This is late for you.
-I got lost.

268
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,995
-Where?
-On the way to work.

269
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,918
-When?
-Now! This morning.

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,878
-You got lost on your way to work?
-Good morning, Carol.

271
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,236
-Good morning, Sam. It's 8: 1 5.
-We'll do messages in a minute.

272
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,797
-Lost on your way to work.
-Don't make fun.

273
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,150
-I wouldn't worry about that.
-I didn't sleep much.

274
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,317
-How much did you sleep?
-None, not at all.

275
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,874
You slept none, not at all?

276
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,872
I am today excited about you
being the president's spokesperson.

277
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,310
Let me ask you something.

278
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,872
I was talking yesterday to a reporter
who's new in the room...

279
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,590
...and he asked me a question,
and in my answer....

280
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,431
Let me ask you something.

281
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,238
You know you haven't
asked me anything yet, right?

282
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,951
-Yeah, listen, never mind.
-C.J.?

283
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,393
-Forget it.
-What is it?

284
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,592
The two of you.
Come take a walk with me.

285
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,355
-What's going on?
-I wanted to tell you with people...

286
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,517
-...around so you wouldn't scream.
-Scream?

287
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,876
The woman who was on
Capitol Beat with Sam Sunday.

288
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,355
-What about her?
-I'm offering her a job.

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,914
-Where?
-Here.

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,269
-Are you kidding?
-No.

291
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,430
-Are you kidding?
-No.

292
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,630
-Are you kidding?
-No.

293
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,992
What the hell made you think I wouldn't
scream where there are people?

294
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,918
-I took a shot.
-Leo!

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,797
Outside.

296
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,193
I haven't honed in on this.

297
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,436
-A lot of people in Africa with HlV.
-Right.

298
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,439
American companies hold
the patents on medicines they need.

299
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,837
Most people in most of Africa can't
afford them so they buy them...

300
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,071
-...off the black market--
-Violating U.S. patents and treaties.

301
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,078
How prohibitively priced are
the drugs?

302
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,352
-About 1 50 bucks a week.
-That's not totally off the charts.

303
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,519
A police officer in Kenya
makes $43 a month.

304
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,958
Do good in there.

305
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,870
-This isn't about profit--
-Sir.

306
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,953
-This isn't about profit--
-Sir, you have interrupted me again.

307
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,030
My apologies, Mr. President.

308
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,039
How can you tell us this isn't
about profit maximization?

309
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,273
You sell Emperex for half the price
in Norway than you do in my country.

310
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,636
-That's not the issue.
-Let's make it the issue.

311
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,917
Let's make it the issue
for the moment.

312
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,918
You can't compare
prices worldwide.

313
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,599
Sir, excuse me, sir.

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,036
I was the one
who asked the question...

315
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,958
...I'd appreciate it if you directed
your answer to me.

316
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
President Nimbala,
when you sell to small pharmacies...

317
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,510
...as we do in Norway,
a different price is set.

318
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,034
Norway....

319
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,352
Norway, $1 0 per unit U.S.
My country, $23 per unit U.S.

320
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,679
Retail markups, taxes, pharmacy
discounts, these things vary widely.

321
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,157
Not to mention we don't know if
the drugs are getting to your citizens.

322
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,872
You're implying corruption
and incompetence.

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,877
We do have reports of that,
Mr. President.

324
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,915
You talk to me about corruption?

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,594
What are your annual sales
of fluconazole alone?

326
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,916
-A billion dollars.
-I don't understand your point.

327
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,960
I think President Nimbala's
saying there's more money...

328
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,789
...in giving a white guy an erection
than curing a black guy of AlDS.

329
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,072
Sir, my company has given away...

330
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,994
...over $1 20 million worth
of free drugs a year...

331
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,228
...including free doses of Xyclacinth,
which is one of two drugs...

332
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,114
...in your country curing
eye infection right now.

333
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,119
They're not dying
from eye infections, Alan.

334
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,628
They' re not dying
because of me either, Toby.

335
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,717
I'd like not to be talked to this way.

336
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,113
If it was 26 million Europeans dying,
we'd have had a solution yesterday.

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,191
How much would it cost
for you to provide free drugs...

338
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,156
...to the Sahelese Republic, Kenya
and the Republic of Equatorial Kuhndu?

339
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,509
I have no idea.

340
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,196
Why not? We're talking about
1 30,000 patients, 200mg pills...

341
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,758
...three times a day, every day,
what's the X factor?

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,956
We don't know how long they'll live.

343
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,109
We're nowhere.

344
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,879
Let's take a break.

345
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,555
-She's here.
-Good.

346
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,909
-Should I send her in?
-Yeah.

347
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,838
-You want me to stay here?
-Why?

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,878
-ln case something should happen?
-What would that be exactly?

349
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,196
-I'll bring her in.
-Thank you.

350
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,798
-Ainsley?
-Mr. McGarry.

351
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,310
-Leo's fine.
-Yes, sir.

352
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,510
Were you offered coffee
or something to drink?

353
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,038
The woman out there, who I imagine is
your secretary, offered me coffee.

354
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,429
She was also kind enough
to ask for my coat.

355
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,075
-Excellent.
-She seems to be a very good secretary.

356
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,672
Well, she'll be happy to hear that,
she's standing right outside the door.

357
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,040
So I have to tell you...

358
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,238
... I've never seen Sam Seaborn get
beat the way you beat him on Monday.

359
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,839
Yes, well, Mr. McGarry--

360
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,558
-Leo.
-Yes, sir.

361
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,434
I've been thinking about
that since your office called...

362
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,153
...and I have something to say.

363
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,512
I understand if you won't let me,
but I would appreciate if you did.

364
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,751
I didn't really follow that,
but whatever.

365
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,719
It is wrong for a man
in your position to summon someone...

366
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,957
...to reprimand them
for voicing opposition.

367
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,435
I think that is wrong,
and it is inappropriate.

368
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,040
It's inappropriate,
and I'll tell you what else--

369
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,237
It's wrong? That's fine, except you
weren't summoned to be reprimanded.

370
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,953
Then why was I summoned?

371
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,396
You have an interesting
conversational style, you know that?

372
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,433
-It's a nervous condition.
-I used to have a nervous condition.

373
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,188
-How did yours manifest itself?
-I drank a lot of Scotch.

374
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,869
-I get sick when I drink too much.
-I get drunk.

375
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,832
-Well, Mr. McGarry--
-Leo.

376
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,469
Yes, sir. I'll ask again. For what
purpose was I brought here today?

377
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,079
So I could offer you a job.

378
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,636
It is not fair that I be expected
to play the role of mouse...

379
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,717
...to the White House's
cat in a game of--

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,115
-You know?
-Cat and mouse?

381
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,198
Yes. And it's not
like I'm not, you know....

382
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,392
The fact that I may not look
like the Republicans who have...

383
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,878
...crossed your path doe's not mean
that I am any less inclined toward--

384
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,916
Here it comes.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,913
-Did you say, " Offer me a job"?
-Yes. Associate White House counsel.

386
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,395
You'd report to the
deputy White House counsel...

387
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,672
...who reports to the White House
counsel, who reports to me.

388
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,793
I'm sorry, a job in this White House?

389
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,957
-You want a glass of Scotch?
-Yes, please.

390
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,559
C.J.?

391
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,760
See a sleep doctor.
Take a pill. Do something.

392
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,511
I rode the Lifecycle this morning
for an hour and a half.

393
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,309
If it was a real cycle,
I'd have been in Belgium by now.

394
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,397
What did you wanna
ask me the other day?

395
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,955
-lf I tell, you could be subpoenaed.
-Don't worry.

396
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,151
-lt could cost you--
-Don't worry about it.

397
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,829
I do worry about it.

398
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,157
There's no problem.
I just need some sleep.

399
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,190
What can I bring into the room
about the conference?

400
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
The sessions are productive.
Progress is being made.

401
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,358
These kind of things take time.
All the parties are optimistic.

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,150
Are any of the parties optimistic?

403
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,032
-No.
-Okay.

404
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,838
C.J.?

405
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,194
-Did you say something to me?
-No.

406
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,469
Because I thought you
might have said something.

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,073
I have always been a Republican.
My father is a Republican.

408
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,433
His father was state chairman
of the North Carolina Republican Party.

409
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,075
When I was young,
I was a Young Republican.

410
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,557
Even if you hadn't already
told me this many, many times...

411
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,440
... I would know it anyway
because I have this FBl file.

412
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,753
You have my FBl file?
I can't believe that.

413
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,989
You have my FBl file?

414
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,395
I have an FBl file?

415
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,875
-Ainsley--
-Mr. McGarry, I loathe...

416
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,918
-...almost everything you believe in.
-Where you going?

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,913
I'm standing up, which is how one
speaks in opposition in a civilized world.

418
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,839
-You go, girl.
-I find this administration smug...

419
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,151
...and patronizing and under the
impression that those who disagree...

420
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,789
...are less than them,
and with colder hearts.

421
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,035
That's not true.

422
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,398
How many people on your staff assumed
that I was ambitious, mean and stupid?

423
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,636
None.

424
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,038
C.J. Cregg thinks you kill your pets.
You don't do that, do you?

425
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,675
No, I don't kill my pets.
I don't have any pets.

426
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,155
I was thinking about getting a pet--
The point is--

427
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,873
-Ainsley.
-Yes, sir.

428
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,918
-Don't you wanna work here?
-Oh, only since I was 2.

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,275
-Okay, then.
-lt has to be this White House?

430
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,669
-Ainsley--
-Mr. McGarry--

431
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,350
The president likes smart people
who disagree with him.

432
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,998
He wants to hear from you.
The president's asking you to serve.

433
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,874
And everything else is crap.

434
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,311
Think about it overnight.

435
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,115
Come back here at 6:00 tomorrow
and give me your answer.

436
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,879
Margaret!

437
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,316
How you doing? Show Miss Hayes out,
would you, please?

438
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,875
This way.

439
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,110
You're listening,
but you're not understanding.

440
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,310
I disagree with you.

441
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,229
That doe'sn't mean I'm not listening to
you or understanding what you're saying.

442
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,158
You gotta get out of their face.

443
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,795
They can leave.
We don't have anything they need.

444
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,310
-Patent treaties need to be enforced.
-They will be.

445
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,478
The drug companies got half
the House of Representatives elected.

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,877
Congress is gonna get serious.
The pills cost 4 cents a unit to make.

447
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,958
You know that's not true.
The second pill cost 4 cents.

448
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,235
The first pill cost them
$400 million.

449
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,830
They also enjoy unprecedented
tax breaks, foreign tax credits...

450
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,993
... research exemptions
and expensing of research expenditures.

451
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,431
And business is pretty good,
so they' re gonna cover their bet.

452
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,399
-T ell me about Nimbala.
-They had no cheese. It's boysenberry.

453
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,558
-A boysenberry Danish?
-It's new.

454
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,195
T ell me about Nimbala.

455
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,635
He's a good president, Josh.

456
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,032
A great soldier,
brilliant commander.

457
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,998
He led his people for 28 years,
he can't get ahead of the curve.

458
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,635
He's cursed by geography.

459
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,794
If the ground won't grow anything,
you don't have an economy.

460
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,670
But still he stands in a room
and he talks about Norman Borlaug.

461
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,831
He came here himself, Josh.
He didn't send delegates.

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,197
I think it's because
he doe'sn't have any.

463
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,950
I think he's holding his country
together with both hands.

464
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,715
Then let's make sure we send him
back with something, is my point.

465
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,476
-Fellas?
-Yeah.

466
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,318
They're ready.

467
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,398
Yeah.

468
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,272
Folks, please take your seats.

469
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,511
Good afternoon. Guess what?

470
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,877
The audit figures released yesterday
by the Senate Finance Committee...

471
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,596
...confirmed earlier reports released
by the Congressional Budget Office...

472
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,474
... regarding the increased
budget surplus projections.

473
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,638
The CBO's projection increased
the surplus from 2 trillion...

474
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,717
...over the next 1 0 years
to 2. 2 trillion.

475
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,197
This exceeds even the most optimistic
estimates published last year...

476
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,869
... by the White House Budget Office
of 300 billion.

477
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,509
And the CBO's projection
last quarter of 900 billion.

478
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,113
Needless to say, these figures....

479
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,992
-Are you new too?
-Excuse me?

480
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,353
-Are you new too? It's my fourth day.
-No.

481
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,595
Maybe you can help me.

482
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,917
I'm trying to find out about drilling
equipment that might've been sold...

483
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,434
... by Bonamo Energy to the lraqis
in violation of sanctions.

484
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,076
I asked C.J. about it, and she said
there's a grand-jury investigation...

485
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,879
...and she's not allowed to talk.

486
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,913
If you ask me, she was acting
a little bit, I don't know....

487
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,191
I hear she hasn't slept
and maybe that's--

488
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,596
She told you there was
a grand-jury investigation?

489
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,677
-Yeah.
-Miss Hayes?

490
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,029
-Yeah.
-This way.

491
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,909
--responsible and put a large portion
of the surplus to debt reduction.

492
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,194
An update on the summit?

493
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,359
With regards to the progress made here
at the summit for African AlDS relief...

494
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,997
...all parties are optimistic that
an agreement will be reached soon.

495
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,316
I think there's a more fundamental
problem than marginal cost.

496
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,797
We've been at this for four days,
and I think we haven't talked...

497
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,913
...about the fundamental
misunderstanding in Africa...

498
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,957
...over the basic facts of AlDS.

499
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,839
There's no misunderstanding.

500
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,832
A week ago you people stood up
and said that AlDS has only...

501
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,992
...a casual relationship to HlV.

502
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,631
I'm not certain to whom you' re
referring when you say, "You people. "

503
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,798
But it was President Mbeki
of South Africa who said that...

504
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,399
...and not anyone in this room.

505
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,116
I think Mr. Damson has brought up
a hard truth that should be faced.

506
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,879
What's that?

507
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,039
If tomorrow we made AlDS medication
free to every patient in your country...

508
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,398
...as much as they needed for as long
as they needed it, it would likely...

509
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,956
... make very little difference
in the spread of the epidemic.

510
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,115
Why?

511
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,759
Anti-HlV drugs are a triple cocktail.

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,639
It's a complicated regimen
that requires 1 0 pills...

513
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,275
...to be taken every day
at precise times.

514
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,034
Two protease inhibitors
every eight hours...

515
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,879
...two combination
RTl pills every 1 2 hours.

516
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,037
What's the problem?

517
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,029
They don't own wristwatches.
They can't tell time.

518
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,430
We agree that something must be done,
but we don't think we're culprits...

519
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,231
...and we don't think there
is an easy or obvious solution.

520
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,876
And we think you should be
aware of the dangers involved...

521
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,157
...in some of the proposals
made here today.

522
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,477
Mr. President, may we speak
with you alone, please?

523
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,353
Ainsley.

524
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,393
Could l--? Could you give me
just a moment, please?

525
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,148
-Sure.
-Thank you.

526
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,029
Excuse me.
I was going to see Leo McGarry.

527
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,192
He asked me to come back and
see him again at the end of the day.

528
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,869
-I'm Ainsley Hayes.
-It's good to meet you.

529
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,235
I'm not taking the job, C.J.

530
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,033
Well....

531
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,114
Okay.

532
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,951
I just wanted to--

533
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,593
Okay.

534
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,151
C.J., Rule 6E of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure says you...

535
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,911
...can be prosecuted for even confirming
a grand jury's been impaneled.

536
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,869
How did you know?

537
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,199
A reporter in your press room, who hasn't
read Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

538
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,870
Well, someone's
gonna tell him eventually.

539
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,030
Who told you?

540
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,271
One of the witnesses who was called.

541
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,869
What could happen?

542
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,756
Eighteen months, medium security.

543
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,069
C.J., I'm kidding.
You didn't break the law.

544
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,157
Attorneys and jurors
are under a gag order.

545
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,158
Witnesses are free
to say what they want.

546
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,954
And anyone is free
to repeat what they've said.

547
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,078
You know, I'm not sure that laying
low and hoping nobody noticed...

548
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,197
...was the best strategy here.

549
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,473
Next time you should really run
it by someone in the counsel's office.

550
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,356
-Anyway, I should go see Leo.
-Yeah.

551
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,911
President Nimbala.

552
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,318
I'm gonna put a deal together
and I want you to agree to it.

553
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,313
-What am I agreeing to?
-I can get them to lower their prices.

554
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,797
But you have to commit your military,
your Customs Bureau...

555
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,638
...and your Ministry of Health.

556
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,356
You have to commit them to stopping
the influx of black-market HlV drugs...

557
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,517
...from Korea and Pakistan...

558
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,035
...and from wherever else
they' re coming.

559
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,357
35.8 percent
of our adult population is infected.

560
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,351
Sixty percent of our hospital beds are
occupied by people who are HlV-positive.

561
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,030
Our lnstitute of Policy Analysis says in
the coming decade...

562
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,793
... 50 percent of all households
in my country...

563
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,789
...will have at least one member
infected with HlV.

564
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,868
T o think I care about international patent
law at a time like this is unrealistic.

565
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,516
Mr. President,
the U.S. Department of Commerce...

566
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,638
...will put your country on a watch list.

567
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,876
That's the first step
toward trade sanctions.

568
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,317
Our Congress could end
all aid to your country.

569
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,429
Or you can agree
to what we'resaying.

570
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,996
In exchange for which we believe we
can get Congress to forgive the debt...

571
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,751
...on all your past development loans,
and we believe the Export-lmport Bank...

572
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,037
...will offer a billion dollars
in loans to finance the purchase...

573
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,917
...of American AlDS medication.

574
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,868
-Congress won't approve the loan.
-Congress won't have to, sir.

575
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,038
The Treasury and the State Department
will review it...

576
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,671
... but if we spread the loans out
over several countries in your region...

577
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,394
...and if none of the loans
exceed $100 million...

578
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,875
...we don't need
congressional approval.

579
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,679
That law might change soon.

580
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,194
It's a terrible thing to beg for your life.

581
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,598
T errible.

582
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,112
My father....

583
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,673
"Proud. "

584
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,837
Proud.

585
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,514
My father was a proud man.

586
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,354
He built homes.

587
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,351
He wouldn't like what
I came here to do.

588
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,399
Yes, he would, Mr. President.
I swear to God he would.

589
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,871
Thank you, sir.

590
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,633
Go tell Leo.

591
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,712
Hi.

592
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,959
Hi.

593
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,872
Something you forgot to mention
about the 95 percent of the money...

594
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,520
...going into the classroom
past the pork-barrel buffet...

595
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,957
...was that the school only got money
if they did not distribute condoms.

596
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,798
That's a reason to veto it.

597
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,038
The thing our public schools need
more than anything are free condoms.

598
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,272
I'd definitely make that priority one.

599
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,750
-Where's Leo?
-He's not here.

600
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,559
You look familiar to me.

601
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,239
You're Aimsley Hayes.

602
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,717
-Ainsley, with an N.
-She works here now.

603
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,989
-What?
-Leo hired her.

604
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,713
-What?
-Leo hired her.

605
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,719
He told me and C.J.,
he was waiting to tell you and Toby.

606
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,639
-What was he waiting for?
-How the hell do I know, Josh?

607
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,070
Waiting until he hired me,
which he hasn't done...

608
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,920
-...because I'm not taking the job.
-You're not?

609
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,675
No. But thank you for talking to me
instead of about me.

610
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,350
Hang on, I'm back on he offered you
the job, but you're not taking the job?

611
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,996
Why participate in the process when
you can get a job commenting on it?

612
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,077
You think I don't want to work here...

613
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,316
... because I can get
a better gig on Geraldo?

614
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,910
Gosh, let's see if there could possibly
be any other reason why I wouldn't...

615
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,918
...want to work in this White House.

616
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,197
This White House that feels government
is better for children than parents.

617
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,871
That looks at 40 years of degrading and
humiliating free lunches handed out...

618
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,511
...in a failed effort to level the playing
field and says, " Let's try 40 more. "

619
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,320
This White House that says of anyone,
that points that out...

620
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,955
...that they are cold and mean
and racist...

621
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,959
...and then accuses Republicans
of using the politics of fear.

622
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,678
This White House that loves
the Bill of Rights. Except the second one.

623
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,996
This is the wrong place
to talk about guns right now.

624
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,876
-I thought your column was idiotic.
-lmagine my surprise.

625
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,950
But for a brilliant surgical team
and 2 centimeters of a miracle...

626
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,995
...this guy's dead right now, from
bullets fired from a gun bought legally.

627
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,835
They bought guns. They loaded them.
They drove from Wheeling to Rosslyn.

628
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,195
Until they pulled the trigger,
they did not commit a crime.

629
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,756
I am tired of the gun lobby tossing
around words like " personal freedom"...

630
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,195
...and nobody calling them on it.

631
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,836
It's not about personal freedom,
and it has nothing to do with safety.

632
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,275
It's just that some people like guns.

633
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,317
Yes, they do.

634
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,869
But you know
what's more insidious than that?

635
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,635
Your gun control position doe'sn't have
anything to do with public safety...

636
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,235
...and it's certainly
not about personal freedom.

637
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,672
It's about you don't like people
who do like guns.

638
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,030
You don't like the people.

639
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,956
Think about that the next time
you make a joke about the South.

640
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,355
Where's Leo?

641
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,709
-What?
-Where's Leo?

642
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,558
We don't know.

643
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,710
Charlie, you seen Leo?

644
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,110
We got a situation.

645
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,559
-Six hundred?
-Yes, sir.

646
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,193
-T elevision and radio?
-They have them.

647
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,391
When do I see pictures
of what I'm looking for?

648
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,272
T en minutes in the Situation Room.

649
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,795
I want Fitzwallace and Nancy.

650
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,548
We're getting in
the early ClC report.

651
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,195
-Donna, tell C.J. it's an open lid.
-She knows, they' re coming back.

652
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,996
Leo?

653
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,315
Excuse us. Excuse me, everybody.

654
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,272
Could we have the room
a moment, please?

655
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,393
Sam.

656
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,554
Mr. President, three hours ago
there was a coup in your country.

657
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,593
The AFRC has taken the capital.

658
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,473
-And my children?
-We're finding out.

659
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,548
The information's coming very quickly
from our people in Angola and Sudan.

660
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,512
Mr. President, I think you should sit.

661
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,432
No, thank you. I'll go now.

662
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,838
No, no. Sir, my State Department
is offering you asylum in the U.S.

663
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,193
Thank you, Mr. President,
but I have to go home.

664
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,789
You can't go home.
You can't go home.

665
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,877
-I'm their leader.
-They have the capital.

666
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,191
They have the radio station,
they have the television station.

667
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,992
-Are there Americans on the ground?
-I'm evacuating the embassy.

668
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,351
-Have they closed the airport?
-Yes.

669
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,350
They'll want to arrest me.

670
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,232
They'll want to put me on trial.

671
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,796
You should trade my return for
the safe departure of the Americans.

672
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,195
I don't need to trade you.

673
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,789
If they won't give me
the Americans, we'll go in.

674
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,550
-They know that and they'll let them go.
-I'd like to call my embassy.

675
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,671
Your embassy is in exile, Mr. President.

676
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,748
They will shoot you
the moment you step off the plane.

677
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,388
Thank you.

678
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,799
Please tell me what is in that message.

679
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,400
We think your brother
and your two sons are already dead.

680
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,877
We think your wife
is being hidden in Kenya.

681
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,629
You understand, don't you,
why I can't offer military assistance?

682
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,477
Yes.

683
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,119
Sit with me for a moment.
Sit down, sir.

684
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,597
And you know they just wanted
to hire her so they could say they did.

685
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,395
" Look at us, we hired a Republican,
look how bipartisan we are.

686
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,148
We didn't even notice
that she looks like a Gap dancer. "

687
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,351
That's right.

688
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,119
-Ainsley.
-Hey.

689
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,277
-Bruce was telling me.
-I couldn't resist.

690
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,398
-So they tried to hire you?
-How did McGarry's face look?

691
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,071
-What?
-When you said no.

692
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,830
I couldn't see him.

693
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,040
He had to....

694
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,032
-He was called into--
-What's wrong?

695
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,953
Nothing. He had to....

696
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,314
Something happened--

697
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,875
I wanted you to say it to his face.
I wanted to see--

698
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,149
I hate these people.

699
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,192
Did you meet anyone
there who isn't worthless?

700
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,550
-Don't say that.
-Did you meet anyone there--?

701
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,910
I said, don't say that.

702
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,588
Say they' re smug and superior.

703
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,429
Say their approach to public policy
makes you wanna tear your hair out.

704
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,598
Say they like high taxes
and spending your money.

705
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,189
Say they want to take your guns
and open your borders.

706
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,550
But don't call them worthless.

707
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,593
At least don't do it in front of me.

708
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,555
The people that I have met
have been extraordinarily qualified.

709
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,798
Their intent is good.
Their commitment is true.

710
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,958
They are righteous.
And they are patriots.

711
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,553
And I'm their lawyer.

712
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,636
You ever read Paul Ehrlich's book?

713
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,913
-The Population Bomb?
-Yeah. He wrote it in 1 968.

714
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,675
Ehrlich said that it was a fantasy
that lndia would ever feed itself.

715
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,155
Then Norman Borlaug comes along.

716
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,040
The problem was that wheat is
top-heavy. It was falling over on itself...

717
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,679
...and it took up too much space.

718
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,075
The dwarf wheat.

719
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,715
Guys, it was
an agricultural revolution...

720
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,913
...that was credited
with saving 1 billion lives.

721
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,911
Thanks.

722
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,277
It happened?

723
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,398
They executed him
in the airport parking lot.

724
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,318
Okay.

725
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,155
I'll see you Monday.

726
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:07,155
