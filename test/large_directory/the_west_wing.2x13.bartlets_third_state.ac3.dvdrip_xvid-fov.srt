Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,354
-A woman named Ainsley Hayes.
-Aimsley?

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,192
-Hire her.
-Welcome to the White House.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,437
-Your poll says that?
-I said that.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,114
-" Vox populi, vox Dei. "
-"The voice of the people...

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,548
...is the voice of a dog "?

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,429
-"The voice of God, " Joshua.
-God.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,635
Y es.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,677
-Hello, pumpkin.
-Abbey?

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,552
Hello, gumdrop.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,678
Shake my hand.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,911
-We just formed it.
-Formed what?

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,350
The Committee to Re-elect the President.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,675
We are minutes away from
the president's entrance...

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,030
... onto the floor
of the House of Representatives.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,710
It's his third State of the Union address.
We 'll hear the introduction...

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,718
... from the doorkeeper of the House,
Edgar Finney.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,549
Some people don 't know that in order
for the president to address Congress...

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,955
... he must receive permission
from the Speaker.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,913
I ' m still here. AII right.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,156
Is that a yes? Is it a yes?

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,588
-Sam?
-Give me half a minute.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,990
Ed. Delete "vigorously"
from the first sentence.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,952
-Which paragraph?
-Three, section seven.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,754
We're not gonna vigorously pursue
campaign finance reform?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,991
-We're just gonna pursue it.
-Not vigorously?

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,589
Not tonight. McGowan feels "vigorous"
is inflammatory.

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,075
-Change "chokehold " to "tight grip. "
-Is that it?

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,470
-No, Sam's still on.
-We got four minutes.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,432
-Where are we?
-Sam's still on.

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,154
Bob Novak said this was the speech
of my political Iife.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,038
Know how many times I've heard that?

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,549
-We're fine if we cut "vigorously. "
-Do it.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,756
-How you feeling?
-Good.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,269
-Abbey's already in her seat?
-Y es, sir.

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,072
-My wife's in her seat?
-Y es, sir.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,596
-We got four minutes.
-Get him in the car. Let's go.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm gonna tell him it's a yes.
Thank you.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,869
-What'd they say?
-We put our weight behind S. B. 380.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,479
-Highway Improvement Bill.
-And?

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,193
-Set aside park Iand.
-What else?

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,834
-That's it.
-I wanna be clear. The understanding :

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,669
We build a highway, name a park after
him, get his support for the BIue Ribbon?

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,835
-Mr. President?
-Do it.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,629
Ginger? T ell C.J. it's a green Iight
on the BIue Ribbon. She'II know.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,400
-Yes, sir.
-We'II write it in the car.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,274
Sir?

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,199
-It's a good thing.
-The BIue Ribbon?

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,238
Excuse me. What are you doing?

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,953
Putting gum in your mouth?

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,673
It's a good idea to chew gum...

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,996
...when you' re taking a poll
for the president.

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,758
That's a sound people Iike to hear.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,712
The polling hasn't started yet.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,798
-Well, thank you, Mr. Helper.
-Josh.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,037
-These people have done this before.
-They' re not our people.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,470
-They' re Joey Lucas' people.
-None have accents?

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,478
-They' re out of the Midwest.
-I'm saying Joey Lucas is deaf--

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,557
-Josh.
-Do any of you people have accents?

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,478
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,035
Do any of you people
have the power of speech?

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,196
-They' re fine.
-I should be there right now.

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,389
He's fine.

64
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,392
Therefore, I am asking the Ieaders of
Congress and members of both parties...

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,388
...to join me in establishing a BIue Ribbon
National Commission to fashion--

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,869
I want it for him when he
walks in the door.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,436
Gail Schumer, can we expect the White
House will be doing its own polling?

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,189
Better believe it. This may be the
speech of the president 's political life.

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,517
Excuse me. I ' ve got a heads up.
There' II be a Iast-minute addition.

70
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,348
The president will announce a
BIue Ribbon Commission...

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,949
...to study the Iong-term future
of entitlement programs.

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,833
-There'II be more details in the address.
-Why Iast-minute?

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,635
You know, when I say "Iast-minute" I'm
wrong. We're just under three minutes.

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,633
-C.J., why Iast-minute?
-He's been going back and forth on it.

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,950
He wanted support
with Democratic Ieadership.

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,428
-And he doe's?
-Y es.

77
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,473
I remind you Capital Beat
is broadcasting from the west wing...

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,719
...for the hours following the address.
So that area is off-Iimits for carousing.

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,639
Capital Beat's doing post-game Iive
from the White House?

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,876
-Y es.
-So why do they get special treatment?

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,998
Because they' re special.
Enjoy the show, everybody.

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,076
"T o build this future will demand
setting aside our partisan blinders...

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,430
...and abandoning our ideological.... "

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,232
What?

85
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,237
" Entrenchment. "

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,877
"T o build this future will demand
setting aside our partisan blinders...

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,230
...and abandoning our ideological
entrenchment. "

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,279
-That's it.
-Okay.

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,471
-This is it.
-Y eah.

90
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,630
Phone it to the prompter.

91
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,716
Mr. President.

92
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,713
-Mr. President.
-Thanks.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,071
Sir.

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,910
-Amen.
-Amen.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,199
Mr. Finney, would you tell the Speaker
I'd Iike to see him, please?

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,995
Mr. Speaker!
The president of the United States!

97
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,957
An America that's continued to rise...

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,754
... through every age,
against every challenge...

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,039
...a people of great works and
greater possibilities who have always...

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,995
... always found the wisdom and strength
to come together as one nation...

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,358
... to widen the circle of opportunity,
to deepen the meaning of our freedom...

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,156
... to form a more perfect union.
Our best days lie ahead.

103
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,597
God bless you. And God bless
the United States of America.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,116
-He did good.
-He can bring it up there.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,835
Up there is where this president eats.
That is his place of business.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,393
Yes, he did well.

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,556
-Let's find out how well.
-This is exciting.

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,035
-Y es. So, what do I do?
-What do you mean?

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,639
-What do I tell them?
-T o start.

110
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,512
Didn't you talk to Joey?
What'd she say?

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,075
-Her plane was Iate.
-What'd she say to tell callers?

112
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,713
-She didn't say anything.
-Donna!

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,918
-T ell them to start.
-Do they receive instructions based on--?

114
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,155
What?

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,150
Time zones? I don't know. I'm not
a pollster. I thought Joey called.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,277
-She was Iate.
-When's she gonna be here?

117
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,917
Joshua Lyman, you have the cutest
Iittle butt in professional politics.

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,759
Really, that better have been her talking.

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,838
-I'm here.
-Where the hell you been?

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,914
-PIane had mechanical difficulties.
-There was nothing you could do?

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,238
No. As a child, I never paid attention
during airplane mechanics class.

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,948
Is this the Noel Cowardesque wit
I can expect all night?

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,509
Yes.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,797
Start the phone banks.
They need instructions.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,834
-Is anyone chewing gum?
-No!

126
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,112
Okay, start.

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,158
I had taken care of the gum thing.

128
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,955
In five, four, three.

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,357
Live from the White House,
it's Capital Beat with Mark Gottfried.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,233
Tonight on Capital Beat,
a special expanded edition:

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,873
The State of the Union.

132
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,752
Good evening. I'm Mark Gottfried...

133
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,269
... and tonight our show is live
from the White House.

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,040
We 'll be joined all night
by Republicans and Democrats...

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,313
... Iawmakers and pundits, and we 'll talk
to focus groups around the country.

136
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,593
On the panel with me now is Deputy
House Majority Whip Henry Shallick.

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,837
And the very Iovely, very talented
Miss CIaudia Jean Cregg...

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,190
...White House press secretary. C.J.

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,356
On a scale of one to 1 0, how did he do?

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,236
Fourteen. You know, Mark, the president
is a commanding public speaker...

141
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,079
...and the bar is set higher
when he makes a major address...

142
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,430
... but tonight he cleared it
with room to spare.

143
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,871
My unofficial tally has him
interrupted for applause 73 times.

144
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,389
I have 72 times, but I'II take your count.

145
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,875
Henry Shallick,
how did the president do tonight?

146
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,992
Well, C.J. is right. The president
is a gifted public speaker.

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,670
We've always known that, and it's an
admirable talent, not unlike juggling.

148
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,038
If only he said something. By my count,
23 of the interruptions for applause...

149
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,231
...were for co-opted Republican ideas.

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,438
Let's break. We're getting started
with our post-game analysis...

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,915
...of the president's third
State of the Union address.

152
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,596
We've got guests around the country.
We'II be back with more Capital Beat...

153
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,472
-... right after this.
-We're out.

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,314
-C.J. 's not wearing pants.
-Y es.

155
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,199
-No pants whatsoever.
-It's cable. Carol?

156
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,590
-Ninety seconds back.
-Could I see you a moment?

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,315
-Could I see you over there?
-How about here? I'm not wearing pants.

158
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,830
-Can we do it here?
-As Iong as there aren't microphones.

159
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,314
Carol?

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,671
-Thank you.
-You Iook Iike a Rockette.

161
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,394
-Y eah.
-You know why I'm not wearing pants?

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,995
-I assumed it was the usual reason.
-I sat in paint.

163
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,668
I went to the sculpture garden
to get some air.

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,393
-I sat on a bench.
-Didn't say "wet paint"?

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,477
-It did, it turns out.
-CIothes are coming.

166
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,352
-Where'd you get the bathrobe?
-Gym.

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,113
-Bathrobes?
-Women's Iocker room.

168
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,194
Not the men's. That's outrageous. A
thousand men work here and 50 women.

169
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,476
And it's the bathrobes that's outrageous.

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,319
-What's going on?
-Jack SIoan has an official reprimand.

171
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,795
-For what?
-Excessive force.

172
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
-How Iong ago?
-Seventeen years ago.

173
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,589
A criminal charge was dismissed.
There was a civil suit, it was dismissed.

174
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,314
There is enormous pressure
from Iocal black Democrats.

175
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,788
-Our people?
-1 7 years ago.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,911
So they gave him
an official condemnation.

177
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,639
-Anybody have the story?
-They will.

178
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,876
-1 0 seconds.
-I need to see the police officer.

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,150
-What was his name?
-SIoan.

180
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,793
AII right.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,991
Take the desk away,
I pick up 3 share points.

182
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,954
In five, four, three.

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,670
We 're back with our panel: Deputy
House Majority Whip Henry Shallick...

184
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,110
...and White House Press Secretary
C.J. Cregg.

185
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,992
-Welcome back.
-How did it Iook on TV?

186
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,155
It Iooked good.

187
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,716
Charlie, is it possible that C.J.
isn't wearing any pants right now?

188
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,275
Yeah. She sat in wet paint.

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,993
And she's not wearing any pants?

190
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,875
Well, she's wearing underwear, Mrs.
Landingham. She hasn't gone smokeless.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,752
Okay.

192
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,916
I didn't understand this note.

193
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,351
The president balanced his checkbook.
He found an outstanding check...

194
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,996
...for $500 that was never cashed. The
check was written by the first Iady...

195
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,590
...to a woman the president never heard
of. He'd Iike you to ask her about it.

196
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,592
The president balanced his checkbook?

197
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,711
-Why?
-He doe's it to relax.

198
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,075
-Okay.
-Y eah.

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,716
Why doe'sn't he just ask the first Iady
about the $500 check himself...

200
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,394
...in the normal course of, you know,
being married to her?

201
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,518
When the president inquires
into the first Iady's bookkeeping...

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,472
...she gets angry with him and yells.

203
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,995
She's gonna get angry
and yell when I inquire.

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,360
-The president doe'sn't care about that.
-Yeah. Okay. This is a good job.

205
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,039
-I saw you on TV.
-Cool.

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,868
To build this future will demand
setting aside our partisan blinders...

207
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,958
...and abandoning
our ideological entrenchment.

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,751
Therefore, I am asking the leaders of
Congress and members of both parties...

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,155
... to join me in establishing a Blue
Ribbon National Commission to fashion--

210
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,551
--boldly setting aside
our partisan blinders...

211
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,116
... and abandoning our ideological
entrenchment. Therefore...

212
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,675
-Come in.
-...I am asking the leaders of Congress...

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,271
... and members of both parties to join me
in establishing a Blue Ribbon...

214
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,472
-... national commission to fashion--
-Mrs. Bartlet?

215
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,318
-Hey, Charlie.
-Am I disturbing you?

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,273
-I just came up to change my clothes.
-Did you sit in paint?

217
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,516
-I'm sorry?
-C.J. sat on wet paint.

218
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,829
In the sculpture garden?

219
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,076
No. I'm not supposed to
go to the reception...

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,748
...in the same clothes
in which I went to the speech.

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,349
I could tell people I have
two outfits exactly alike.

222
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,676
-That's what I'd do.
-What do you need?

223
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,839
Bear in mind that I'm not wearing pads,
a helmet or contact gear of any kind.

224
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,992
A $500 check that hasn't been cashed.
It's written to a woman--

225
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,273
-Oh, how Iong has that been up his ass?
-Well, I wouldn't know, ma'am, but--

226
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,398
Her name is Jane Robinson.
I read an article a few months ago.

227
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,949
-Her husband threw her out?
-He set fire to the bed.

228
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,430
-Christmas presents were ruined.
-I sent her $500.

229
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,870
She hasn't cashed it.
I'II make sure she got it.

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,230
Thank you, ma'am.

231
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,712
--in establishing a Blue Ribbon
National Commission....

232
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,195
Hey, it's Sam Seaborn, everybody.

233
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,235
See? You guys said
I couldn't write comedy.

234
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,153
You talked to C.J.?

235
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,473
The dial groups are huge.
Middle-class tax cuts, Social Security--

236
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,075
-What about polling?
-Josh and Joey will have numbers.

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,635
My point is, this police officer?

238
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,598
The president asked him to stand.

239
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,392
-Leo.
-Let C.J. talk to him.

240
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,715
Is he here?

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,916
No pictures anywhere near the president.

242
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,599
They need you in the Situation Room.

243
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,199
-What's going on?
-Leo, we believe five U.S. DEA agents...

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,868
-... have been abducted in Colombia.
-Where?

245
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,793
On a road between Bogotá
and a training base in Putumayo.

246
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,837
-Was it the CRF?
-We don't know.

247
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,719
Do we think it was the CRF?

248
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,030
Can agents be identified
as U S. DEA?

249
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,716
-They' re carrying badges.
-On a road from Bogotá to Putumayo?

250
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,838
They' re gonna shoot these guys.

251
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,190
The White House press corps is upstairs.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,910
And there's a Iive TV show
being broadcast next door.

253
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,238
I need to meet with State Justice and the
Pentagon, and it needs to happen softly.

254
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,072
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,438
This was almost a good night.

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,716
Good evening. My name 's Melissa.
I'm from the National Strategies Group...

257
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,953
...in Washington D. C. I'm taking a poll
for the president of the United States.

258
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,280
-Are you a voting-age member...?
-I'm taking a poll for the president....

259
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,670
Donna.

260
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,235
It's going well.
It's a 1 7 percent response rate.

261
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,317
-Great.
-Jack SIoan was reprimanded...

262
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,034
...for excessive force
by the Detroit Police Department.

263
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,753
-How Iong ago?
-Seventeen years.

264
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,188
-What happened?
-I don't know.

265
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,277
He made a bust.
He broke the guy's Ieg.

266
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,830
DA couldn't make the case. The
civil suit was dismissed, but it's there.

267
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,951
-Who's Jack SIoan?
-From tonight.

268
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,910
-The police officer.
-I wasn't there.

269
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,798
I was on a plane with difficulties.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,434
Officer Jack SIoan
of the Detroit Police Department...

271
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,677
...was added at the Iast minute to the
invited guests recognized...

272
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
-... by the president during the speech.
-He was the cop--

273
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,755
At the elementary school?

274
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,678
-He wasn't vetted?
-It was Iast-minute.

275
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,871
-When do I see numbers?
-It's going good.

276
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,998
-When do I see numbers?
-There's a 1 7 percent response rate.

277
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,913
-Fantastic! When do I see numbers?
-You need patience.

278
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,593
I need numbers, T onto.

279
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,194
-The poll's an hour old.
-You get early numbers.

280
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,396
-You'II have them.
-In the meantime?

281
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,756
I'm getting a doughnut.

282
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,072
Okay.

283
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,671
We're plagued by this nonsense, Donna.
It's reaching epidemic proportions.

284
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,111
Those numbers are gonna tell us
we had a big night.

285
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,788
The bounce is gonna be dragged down
by a news cycle...

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,037
-...that won't shake the cop story.
-You should ask her out.

287
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,953
-I'm sorry?
-Ask Joey out.

288
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,469
-T onight could be the night.
-The night to do what?

289
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,789
-T o ask her out.
-Get a doughnut.

290
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,197
Okay.

291
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,640
Before we go to commercial,
let me ask for predictions.

292
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,118
How big a bump doe's the president get
off the speech?

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,873
-Excuse me. Mr. Secretary?
-Y es?

294
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,356
Sorry to interrupt. Leo McGarry
was wondering if you'd come say hello...

295
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,391
-...to an old friend of his?
-Certainly.

296
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,556
-Would you excuse me?
-It's quite all right.

297
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,433
-Sit Room.
-Thank you.

298
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,155
Are we verifying exactly
who was at the Iab?

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,955
We verified Agents McGrath and Nun,
but we still can't confirm the other three.

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,913
-I don't want to misnotify the families.
-Leo.

301
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,032
Mickey, 2 p. m. Iocal time in Bogotá...

302
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,479
...five DEA agents assisting police
in evidence-gathering at a cocaine Iab...

303
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,238
...were taken by the CRF.

304
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,711
-Are they alive?
-We think so.

305
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,599
Okay. Putumayo is a Frente stronghold.

306
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,598
The agents were at one of their
top-producing cocaine Iabs.

307
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,268
We open a dialogue through
Colombian army commanders.

308
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,909
-Who are they talking to?
-I think it's Nelson Guerra.

309
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,190
-He's a Frente jefe.
-Get me everything on him.

310
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,715
-Y es, sir.
-Is anybody close by on the ground?

311
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,793
-The closest we've got is T res Encinas.
-Who's there?

312
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,598
Six commanders and 1 3 support.

313
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,239
Really? How many people are gonna
guard where these guys are taken to?

314
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,675
-Five, 600.
-Not the numbers you' re hoping for...

315
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,314
...for a massive attack
and rescue mission.

316
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,312
No.

317
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,436
T ell Special Operations at Ft. Bragg
to submit plans for unilateral op.

318
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,755
-They have an hour.
-Yes.

319
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,475
We should Iet these 1 9 guys
at T res Encinas know they' re in it now.

320
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,716
Y es, sir.

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,992
I challenge all our schools to teach
character education.

322
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,634
To teach values. To teach citizenship.

323
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,753
If it means our kids 'll pay more attention
to mathematics and English literature...

324
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,715
... and history and science and the arts
and less attention to designer labels...

325
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,358
... then public schools should be able to
require students to wear school uniforms.

326
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,551
" School uniforms "
from a Iiberal Democrat.

327
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,478
What was that sound we just heard?

328
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,559
Joining us now on our panel is Associate
White House Counsel Ainsley Hayes.

329
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,197
T o my Ieft, Gretchen Tyler, director
of public education for the ACLU.

330
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,755
Gretchen, Iet's start with you.
Were you surprised?

331
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,155
I was surprised, Mark.
I was disappointed.

332
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,710
This president has always had
strong First Amendment credentials.

333
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,111
-What's the position of the ACLU?
-The position of the ACLU is that...

334
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,716
...every child in the country has
a Iegal right to public school education.

335
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,469
And that right can't be conditioned
upon compliance with a uniform policy.

336
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,792
-Ainsley?
-I think Gretchen's point is well taken...

337
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,192
...in that I'm not 100% sure what the
president suggested was constitutional.

338
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,551
What I can tell you is, he 's concerned
about the kid who 's left out...

339
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
...because he can 't afford the clothes
his friends wear.

340
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,637
He 's also taken serious notice
of any number of studies...

341
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,479
... done by education experts
that say, by and large...

342
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,477
... kids will do better wearing uniforms.

343
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,559
It should be noted that there already are
dress restrictions on public school kids.

344
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,194
T hey' re not allowed to wear
inappropriate clothing...

345
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,277
...or something obscene on their T -shirt.

346
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,550
It should also be noted
those restrictions...

347
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,836
...were over the strong objection
of the ACLU.

348
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,436
Ainsley, gage for us how strongly
the president feels about this.

349
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,557
He included it in a
State of the Union.

350
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,950
But from your conversations
with him personally.

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,997
I haven't had conversations with him.

352
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,595
-On this?
-On anything. I've never met him.

353
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,793
I'm an associate counsel. The Chinese
food guy's got more access than I do.

354
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,674
Y et they have you out here
speaking for the White House?

355
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,036
Yeah, it's a really big night for me.

356
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,708
We'II be back with Gretchen Tyler
and Ainsley Hayes...

357
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,717
...and more guests as the night goes on.

358
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,070
We're gonna send you
to New Y ork for other news.

359
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,838
-Here's Frank and Judy.
-We're out.

360
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,156
-You crack me up.
-Thank you.

361
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,794
-Hey, Gracie.
-Hey, Sam.

362
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,833
-Mark, doe's she have time?
-It's a five-minute news break.

363
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,192
-Have you been watching?
-Y es.

364
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,118
Aren't I delightful?

365
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,197
Yes. You know what I'd Iike?

366
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,678
I'd Iike it if you didn't say you weren't
100% sure the proposal is constitutional.

367
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,348
The ACLU has a reasonable case
against the president.

368
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,677
They do a fine job making it without
the help of the president's Iawyer.

369
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,757
-That's fair.
-You never met the president?

370
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,791
-I haven't.
-You've been here for months.

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,197
He works in the Oval Office.
I work in steampipe trunk distribution.

372
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,198
-We haven't run into each other.
-I'II set it up.

373
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,675
-Meet him tonight. It's no problem.
-Yes, it is.

374
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,836
-Scared to meet him?
-I'm not scared.

375
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,752
-You are.
-I am not scared...

376
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
-... because I'm not gonna.
-Ainsley.

377
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,715
I'm having a good night.
I wanna keep having it.

378
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,354
I don't wanna fear the inevitable
bungling of Ianguage...

379
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,949
-...that will occur, and the mortification.
-Sounds bad.

380
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,199
I am. Y es, I am indeed.
Y es, I am scared to meet the president.

381
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,237
-It sounds really bad. Okay.
-Y es.

382
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,472
-When you meet him, you meet him.
-No need to rush that day along.

383
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,116
Right. Okay, can I talk to you
about adrenaline for a second?

384
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,197
-Adrenaline?
-Y eah. You're feeling it now.

385
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,279
There will be more because it's a big
night. You never experienced this before.

386
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,597
-Think I'II have a nutty?
-Don't drink till you' re off television.

387
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,394
God! Thanks for that debating tip.
Your feel for nuance!

388
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,068
I shouldn't be drunk when
representing the White House.

389
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,840
Yeah. And don't forget
you' re a blond Republican girl...

390
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,996
...and that nobody Iikes you.

391
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,239
-I'm going back on television now.
-T ry and remember you' re on our side.

392
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,279
Thank you, thank you.
Sam Seaborn wrote that Iine for me.

393
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,871
There's a Iot of polling
going on right now.

394
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,231
The instant-dial focus groups
predict tonight's speech was a success.

395
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,393
And I'm sure where Josh is over at the
phone banks they'II be confirming that.

396
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,989
But when numbers are crunched
and polls are taken...

397
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,792
... I think everyone here realizes...

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,037
...that the truly important thing
is that I changed my hair.

399
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Seriously, this is not my official toast.
My official toast is Iater.

400
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,549
I just wanted to say informally
before the president got here...

401
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,278
...thank you so much for your hard work.
And enjoy tonight's success.

402
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,719
-Your hair Iooks great, by the way.
-So, what's going on with Jack SIoan?

403
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,831
C.J. 's on it.

404
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,238
So we were able to get in the Ianguage
about the BIue Ribbon Commission.

405
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,192
We were able to get it in Iast-minute.

406
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,000
We got our guys.
We changed the Ianguage to broaden--

407
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,832
I was there, Leo.

408
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,350
We changed the Ianguage
at the Iast minute.

409
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,869
You wanna be pissed,
the architect of this speech--

410
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,640
I don't wanna be pissed at anyone.
But thanks for asking.

411
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,799
And I don't need to be told who
the architect of tonight's speech was.

412
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,275
It's Toby Ziegler!

413
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,231
In your office in half an hour.
Got it?

414
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,358
-Yes, ma'am.
-Keep shaking hands.

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,228
-He didn 't say that.
-Hang on.

416
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,715
He didn 't say that,
and we can roll the tape.

417
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,872
-He said--
-He said standardized testing...

418
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,998
... would be more acceptable
if its limitations were understood.

419
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,988
What about the New York City testing
scores Hal Chafey just cited a while ago?

420
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,112
-Six out of 1 0 were black or Hispanic.
-Chafey forgot to mention...

421
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,153
... that six out of 1 0 of those
students were black or Hispanic.

422
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,515
-On the button.
-Josh--

423
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,075
-No. We're still doing this?
-Have you asked her out?

424
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,157
-Donna.
-The Iast time I asked, you hadn't.

425
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,353
-What is taking so Iong?
-"Would you Iike to go out Friday night? "

426
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,915
You have to say it.
You have to ask a girl on a date.

427
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,111
You can't just randomly
tumble into a girl...

428
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,515
...and hope she breaks up with you
as always.

429
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,079
-Why not?
-Because you can't.

430
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,511
-You said I always do.
-I can help you or not. It's up to you.

431
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,234
-I choose not helping me.
-Want me to ask her for you?

432
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,000
-Y eah. That's exactly what I want.
-Joey.

433
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,198
Sit down. Where are the first numbers?

434
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,669
-Soon.
-How soon?

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,155
-Five minutes.
-You said that 1 5 minutes ago.

436
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,277
-The response rate slowed down.
-Why?

437
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,356
-People are going to bed.
-But the response rate didn't stop, right?

438
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,189
Everybody didn't go to bed.
If they did, that would be phenomenal.

439
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,188
The response rate slowed down and you
need to have some juice and crackers.

440
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,035
America is talking and I'm trying to hear
what they' re saying.

441
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,558
They' re saying that you' re an egomaniac
who needs to know the public Ioves you.

442
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,911
And you'II have the numbers
in five minutes.

443
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,118
I don't think that is what they' re saying,
but, absent information--

444
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,311
-Josh--
-Joey, it's the State of the Union.

445
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,718
-We worked on the speech three months.
-You will hear America speaking.

446
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,758
-In five minutes?
-In five minutes.

447
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,995
-What the hell?
-My computer's down.

448
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,313
It may take a Iittle Ionger now.

449
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,948
Excuse me.

450
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,470
But this White House uses the First
Amendment to protect flag burning...

451
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,432
... pornography, to ban school prayer.

452
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,915
Why, when the Second Amendment
clearly says...

453
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,317
...that the federal government will not
infringe upon a citizen's right...

454
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,196
-...to keep and bear arms--
-It doe'sn't say that.

455
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,709
The only way it says that
is if you remove words.

456
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,195
-You're--
-It says, "A well-regulated militia...

457
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,796
... being necessary for security of a free
state, government shall not infringe. "

458
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,600
" Regulated " and " militia"
are in the first sentence.

459
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,877
I don't think the framers were thinking
of guys in a Dodge Durango.

460
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,350
-You don't know what they' re thinking.
-No.

461
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,478
If you combine the populations
of Great Britain, France, Germany...

462
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,070
...Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark
and Australia, you get a population...

463
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,068
... roughly the size of the United States.
We had 32,000 gun deaths Iast year.

464
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,554
They had 1 1 2.

465
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,433
Think it's because Americans
are more homicidal by nature?

466
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,473
Or do you think it's because
those guys have gun control Iaws?

467
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,072
We're gonna talk to some people
and hear answers to that question.

468
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,669
You're watching an expanded edition
of Capital Beat.

469
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,916
Live from the west wing
of the White House.

470
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,588
-We'II be back after this.
-We're out.

471
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,478
Toby.

472
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,796
I'm gonna sit out the next segment.

473
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,958
I gotta see someone.
We'II get you a body.

474
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,994
-Has she been waiting Iong?
-No.

475
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,788
-Sorry I'm Iate.
-That's fine.

476
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,228
-On the air.
-I want to ask--

477
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,793
-Mrs. Bartlet.
-Toby?

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,754
Excuse me. I want to remind you there's
press coming in and out of this area.

479
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,997
Are you under the impression
I am going to have a fit of some kind?

480
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,992
-No, ma'am.
-So, what was the deal?

481
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,992
A highway and a park named after him?

482
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,678
-The BIue Ribbon--
-The BIue Ribbon Commission is swell.

483
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,348
I am not talking about
the BIue Ribbon Commission.

484
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,075
And don't talk to me Iike I'm
other people. You've never done that!

485
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,474
It was the Ianguage.

486
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,670
-Mrs. Bartlet--
-The draft I read said :

487
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,792
"The first fiscal priority
of the government must be, will be...

488
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,275
...ensuring Social Security
and Medicare. "

489
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,155
Now, how did that turn into " boldly
setting aside our partisan blinders"?

490
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,311
-White House considering new options?
-Look--

491
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,953
-Raising retirement age?
-Abbey--

492
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,236
How did school uniforms
get a prominent spot?

493
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,238
It was in a section on education reform,
Abbey.

494
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,716
Considering other options doe'sn't mean
we'recaving on retirement age.

495
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,070
So, what was your concern
with the Ianguage?

496
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,556
The draft said:
" Our commitment to the full benefits...

497
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
... promised to America's
greatest generation is absolute. "

498
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,120
-I was there when you wrote it.
-Our commitment is absolute.

499
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,072
We're open to new ideas, as it said.

500
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,548
-Oh, please!
-Believe me.

501
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,512
We gave Republicans
plenty to be pissed about.

502
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,955
The surplus, missile defense,
capital gains.

503
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,993
I was just on TV for the 900th time
and alienated gun owners...

504
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,033
...to say nothing of people
who own Dodge Durangos.

505
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,432
So, what exactly was your problem
with the Ianguage?

506
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,557
It seemed....

507
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,837
-Abbey?
-I was thrown by Iast-minute changes.

508
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,439
You should get back on TV.

509
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,191
He's here?

510
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,916
-Officer SIoan?
-Y es, ma'am?

511
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,192
I'm C.J. Cregg, press secretary.
Sorry to get you out of the party.

512
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,389
It's all right.

513
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,194
I'm sorry to be abrupt,
but I'm racing the clock a Iittle.

514
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,550
Could you tell me what happened
1 7 years ago...

515
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,513
...with a suspect named Walter T appis?

516
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,112
I can access information through the FBI.
I can call Wayne County DA--

517
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,113
-Do I need a Iawyer?
-I don't think so, but if you'd Iike--

518
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,713
No. It was an armed robbery in progress.
I was pursuing Walter T appis on foot...

519
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,469
...through a series of fenced-in
storage areas behind a warehouse.

520
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,593
I apprehended him and tried to cuff him.
During it he broke my hand and nose.

521
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,752
-So you fractured his Ieg?
-I didn't fracture his Ieg.

522
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,872
He said you kicked him repeatedly
while he was handcuffed.

523
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,355
He was suing the city
for five million dollars.

524
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,596
What possible motivation
would he have to Iie?

525
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,630
-Officer--
-He was 1 9 years old, 6' 2", 1 90 pounds.

526
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,271
He won two bronze medals at state high
school track and field championships.

527
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,472
Miss Cregg, Iook at me.

528
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,635
Do you think I'd catch up to this guy
if his Ieg isn't fractured already?

529
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,275
It didn't happen.

530
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,308
Why didn't you tell anybody this was on
your record when you were invited here?

531
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,797
I just assumed. I mean, because
of what happened over the weekend...

532
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,758
...at the elementary school.

533
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,318
I assumed, you know,
that it was okay now, that I was okay.

534
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,516
I didn't think it
was gonna come up again.

535
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,473
-Doe's the press know?
-No, but I have to tell them.

536
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,039
-Why?
-They'II find out.

537
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,913
I have to stay ahead of the pitch.
If I issue a statement...

538
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,033
...it doe'sn't Iook Iike we'retrying to hide
anything. I control the story for a while.

539
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,872
-There is no story.
-Officer--

540
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,311
The DA couldn't bring a case.
The civil suit was dismissed.

541
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,755
The president pointed to you
as an example.

542
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,434
-I am an example.
-It's a story.

543
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,518
-Because you' re giving it to them.
-They'II find it anyway.

544
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,797
-You don't know that.
-Y es, I do.

545
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,110
My wife and kids are back at the party.

546
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,115
You should go back there.

547
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,440
Don't talk to anybody about this.

548
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,430
I wish you'd said something to us before.

549
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,588
Yeah. I just assumed.
I thought it was okay now.

550
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,396
-Okay. Good news.
-What's happening?

551
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,479
The electric power company says outage
was caused by a 1 3,000-volt cable...

552
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,717
...that caught fire in a building
on N Street and Wisconsin.

553
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,150
-How is that good news?
-We have hard information.

554
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,233
-When's the power back on?
-That information isn't available.

555
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,869
-Donna?
-The outage affects 2000 customers.

556
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,950
And it was Iikely started when
a repairman misspliced something.

557
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,679
Call Sam.

558
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,236
-I want the numbers!
-Everybody else is having fun with this.

559
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,074
You're the only one who's having fun.
Nobody else is.

560
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,670
Boo! How are you doing?

561
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,229
-Are those numbers safe?
-Y es.

562
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,670
Are we gonna be able to make
West Coast calls?

563
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,275
-That depends when the power goes on.
-When's that?

564
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,994
-T onight.
-Do I Iook Iike EIectricity Girl?

565
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,310
-No.
-I'm thinking of Ieading a song.

566
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,478
Is that Sam? Give him to me.

567
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,869
-Sam?
-What's going on?

568
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,832
-The power's down.
-I know.

569
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,031
We're minutes away
from an East Coast sample.

570
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,038
-Got nothing west of Indiana or IIIinois.
- You need anything?

571
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,674
A Iightning bolt, a key and a kite.

572
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,229
Donna told me to tell you
to ask out Joey Lucas.

573
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,597
-Can I tell you? Donna's been acting--
-I gotta go.

574
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,233
We're in.

575
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,192
-Sir.
-How's it going?

576
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,391
-Lost power at National Strategies.
-I heard.

577
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,874
-Well done.
-Thank you.

578
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,878
Listen, you scored big
on some of the stuff I fought you on.

579
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,833
-Y es. I know a way you can repay me.
-Repay you for what?

580
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,679
-For you being wrong, me being right.
-I owe you money?

581
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,552
-Not money, sir.
-I owe you anything?

582
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,273
-Great job, Mr. President.
-Thanks.

583
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,516
Ainsley Hayes has worked here
three months.

584
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,837
She's frightened of meeting you.
If you run into her in the halls...

585
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,918
... maybe you could introduce yourself
and welcome her personally.

586
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,396
-Don't you already get paid?
-In the hallways, in the next few days...

587
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,795
...you are bound to be in the same place.
I'm just--

588
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,228
-Mr. President.
-Hang on.

589
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,954
Is there anything in particular
you'd Iike me to say?

590
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,151
If you said something
along the Iines of:

591
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,955
" People assumed you were hired because
you' re a blond, Republican sex kitten.

592
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,072
They were obviously wrong. "
And to keep up the good work.

593
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,158
That's really good.

594
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,590
Mr. President.

595
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,471
-Mr. President.
-The police officer?

596
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,638
-C.J. 's Iooking into it.
-We're gonna get knocked off the story--

597
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,149
The cop isn't what's gonna
knock us off the story.

598
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,275
-What is?
-We have a situation in Colombia.

599
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,072
-They can be identified as agents?
-They' re dressed as civilians.

600
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,431
-But they've got DEA badges.
-Y eah, they may have blown their cover.

601
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,354
-Sir.
-How do we know they' re still alive?

602
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,556
Human sources paid
by the national police...

603
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,433
-...confirm they' re in a CRF outpost.
-They kill our guys...

604
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,717
... unless Santos releases Juan Aguilar
from a prison in Bogotá.

605
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,315
-The Colombian government won't.
-It doe'sn't matter.

606
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,636
-Why?
-The Frente doe'sn't care about Aguilar...

607
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,718
...and how Iong he stays in jail,
they want to kill these guys.

608
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,679
-I don't think--
-They want to drag their bodies.

609
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,237
These people provide 70 percent
of the world's cocaine.

610
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,432
They have 1 22,000 hectares of coca.

611
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,798
The Putumayo region alone produced
$400 million in cocaine Iast year.

612
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,157
The government has no control
over the region. There is no Iaw.

613
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,312
They' re gonna shoot these guys
in the head and have a parade.

614
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,676
If they wanted to kill them,
they'd be dead.

615
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,399
-Robbie.
-Okay, Mr. President.

616
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,279
This plan is called Cassiopeia.
Three MH-60 BIack Hawks...

617
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,711
...two MH-6 Little Birds
and an AC-1 30 gunship.

618
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,633
Each BIack Hawk has 1 0
Delta commandos from Special Forces.

619
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,432
-How Iong?
-Five to seven minutes.

620
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,639
-How many Frente casualties?
-Do you care?

621
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,238
-No.
-Mr. President.

622
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,516
I want to urge
that we continue negotiating.

623
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,196
-You think we'reheaded for Vietnam?
-If we attack, the Frente'II hit back.

624
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,471
-How?
-I think they'II bomb our embassy.

625
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,393
I think they will kill diplomats
and citizens in captivity.

626
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,672
AII require a military response.
It could unify the drug Iords.

627
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,633
It could destabilize the region.
It could Iead to a war.

628
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,472
Lead to a war, we'rein a war.

629
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,632
We're sending people down there
to fight a war on drugs.

630
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,348
Those guys aren't hostages,
they' re prisoners.

631
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,955
How Iong's it gonna take
Special Forces to mobilize?

632
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,589
They' re in 1 41 s now
on their way to T res Encinas.

633
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,268
You can give them a "go" order
in three hours.

634
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,469
Well, then, I want our people
to keep talking to Nelson Guerra.

635
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,280
In three hours,
be ready to kick in the back door.

636
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,636
-Yes, sir.
-Leo, I'd Iike the senior staff.

637
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,592
-Would you round them up?
-Y es, sir.

638
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,870
-I'm gonna be wandering the halls.
-Thank you.

639
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,274
Thank you, sir.

640
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,389
You know what I'm surprised about?

641
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,478
-What?
-We haven't seen a Iot of Iooting.

642
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,388
Usually in these cases you see Iooting.

643
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,318
General civil unrest.

644
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,637
-People get on each other's nerves.
-Okay.

645
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,919
Joey, can I ask you
what may be a silly question?

646
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,631
-Sure.
-It's not possible, is it...

647
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,032
...to just open up one of these computers
with a screwdriver and get the numbers?

648
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,635
-Why'd you think that's a silly question?
-I want these numbers!

649
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,034
Josh?

650
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,357
Sam.

651
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,272
-You gotta come back.
- What's going on?

652
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,916
I don't know. Leo wants everybody back.
Leave Joey and Donna for a while.

653
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,832
I'II be right there.

654
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,713
Ginger?

655
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,751
Isn't Ainsley Hayes
supposed to meet me?

656
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,190
-She's in her office.
-Isn't she to meet me here?

657
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,436
-She needs to meet you in her office.
-Why?

658
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,829
She can't wear her pants.

659
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,913
Ainsley?

660
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,791
-I hardly know where to start.
-I was feeling good after my segments...

661
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,195
-...so I went to the sculpture garden.
-You know...

662
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,791
-...there's a "wet paint" sign.
-My assistant went to get me clothes.

663
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,628
-Why are you moving Iike that?
-I'm blaming it on the bossa nova.

664
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,549
I know what you mean about that
adrenaline high, I definitely think I got it.

665
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,478
The bartender made me a Pink Squirrel.

666
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,831
So you see, I am not
the teetotaler you think I am.

667
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,959
-Is there alcohol in that at all?
-A dash of crème de cacao, my friend.

668
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,599
-I came down here to tell you--
-Oh, dance with me, Sam.

669
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,236
-What's up?
-Oh, Mr. President.

670
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,391
I never knew we had a nightclub
down here.

671
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,432
Oh, my God!

672
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,033
Mr. President, I don't believe
you've met Ainsley Hayes.

673
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,075
Y eah, Ainsley, I wanted to say hello
and to mention, you know...

674
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,636
... people assumed you were hired
because you were a blond Republican...

675
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,594
...sex kitten and, well,
they' re obviously wrong.

676
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,598
-Keep up the good work.
-Y es, sir.

677
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,319
-Know we'remeeting?
-Y es, sir.

678
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,873
Okay.

679
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,631
That could've been worse.

680
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,276
No, probably not.

681
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,158
Take us behind the scenes. What are the
president and first Iady doing right now?

682
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,557
The reception's still going on,
I don't know if you can hear the music.

683
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,751
They are Iikely
to stay up Iate with friends.

684
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,555
AII right, we'restaying up Iate too.
Maybe we'II get invited to the party.

685
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,955
We're gonna take a break
and come right back.

686
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,310
-We're out.
-How you holding up?

687
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,829
You got a second?

688
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,715
I've Iaid off it because
we've done things together.

689
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,797
-I didn't want to ambush you--
-SIoan?

690
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,109
-Yeah. C.J.
-Mark.

691
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,113
I talked to the guy. Before
the stampede begins, give me a--

692
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,958
C.J.?

693
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,555
-Let me talk to you before--
-C.J.?

694
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,310
Leo McGarry would Iike you
to meet a friend.

695
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,590
-Give me 20 minutes.
-Why?

696
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,071
-We've done things together.
-I'm Iooking at my watch.

697
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,272
-They said you were here.
-Just for a minute.

698
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,232
Fellas?

699
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,474
-You're mad at me.
-You know what, I'm not your mommy.

700
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,157
Abbey, so I indicated we were open to
new ideas, how did I fail you this time?

701
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,628
You didn't fail anybody.

702
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,230
They've been giving you
some pretty decent style points.

703
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,191
I have a meeting.

704
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,597
At what point in the process
did you decide not to mention...

705
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,196
-...the Violence Against Women Act?
-Things had to be cut.

706
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,758
Jane Robinson, by the way, is the name
of the woman I made the check out to.

707
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,873
It wasn't cashed because she framed it.

708
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,310
Charlie tracked her down
at a women's shelter.

709
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,478
That's what made me think about
the Violence Against Women's Act.

710
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,195
T o make a 90-minute speech into
an 80-minute speech, things had to go.

711
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,592
It's good it didn't have to be shorter, or
school uniforms might not have made it.

712
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,393
We had a deal.

713
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,273
-Right now--
-We made a promise. We made a deal!

714
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,914
When did you decide you were
gonna run for a second term?

715
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,510
-That's not what tonight's speech--
-That's all tonight's speech was about!

716
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,357
You kicked off your re-election campaign.

717
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,597
And I'm sitting here, eating a sandwich
because we had a deal.

718
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,035
That was three years ago.

719
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,031
I have Special Forces
headed to Colombia on ready-alert.

720
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,630
-They'II be ready in Iess than three hours.
-What happened?

721
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,792
The Frente took five DEA agents
in Putumayo.

722
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,070
Mr. President? Senior staff's together.

723
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,077
-I'II be right there.
-Y es, sir.

724
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,154
-Abbey--
-No, you gotta focus right now.

725
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,671
AII right.

726
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,518
-I've gotta go.
-I'II stay up with you.

727
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,273
Welcome back. If you 're just joining us,
we 're live tonight...

728
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,313
... from the west wing of the
White House with an all-star panel.

729
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,638
We 're talking about the State of the
Union. It appears that it 's a blockbuster.

730
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,310
Claire Willow joins us now
from the Chicago Sun-Times.

731
