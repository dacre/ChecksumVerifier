00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,039
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,070
Mr. Tribbey.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,239
-I see they found you an office.
-Such as it is.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,115
Good men and women have worked
in whatever room available...

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,675
...and without complaint.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,468
Can we clear up a few things
about my level of interest...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,434
...in the revolving door
of local gomers that you see.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,598
I have no problem with
dating the press secretary.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,117
Well, I have a problem, so....

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,278
He wants to meet with me
on the way back?

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,710
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,270
-On the way back?
-Yes, sir.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,476
The assistant energy secretary is flying
to Portland in the middle of the night...

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,639
...so he can meet with me
on Air Force One on the way back?

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,359
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,309
The day-to-day experience
of my life has changed...

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,956
...in many ways since taking this job.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,479
I would imagine, sir.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,599
Before we get on the plane,
let me give you a couple additions...

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,273
...to the passenger manifest.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,031
Gerald Wegland, assistant energy
secretary, is now on the flight...

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,311
...as well as Mr. Latham, the head of
the White House military office...

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,868
...or WHAMO, as we have taken
over my strong objection, to calling it.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,630
Also on this evening's trip are Deputy
Communications Director Sam Seaborn...

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,157
-...and, well, me.
-I thought you weren't going on the trip.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,750
-I am now going.
-Are you being punished?

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,433
I am not being punished.
I am going.

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,033
If the whole bus goes off the record, will
you tell us why you're going on the trip?

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,235
-I made fun of Notre Dame.
-No, no, no.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,875
I usually get away with it.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,230
-They're playing Michigan tomorrow.
-I know that now.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,239
You can't bring that stuff
when they're playing Michigan.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,911
I'll have a lot of time to think about that
on the midnight ride to Portland.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,314
Wheels-up is 9:05, we'll touch down
in Portland before midnight local time.

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,599
-Mr. President.
-How you doing?

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,956
-I just got off with Bruno and Hess.
-I'm sorry?

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,278
-I just got off with Bruno and Hess.
-You didn't say Michigan sucks?

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,717
-No, sir.
-I thought you said Michigan sucks.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,919
No, we're standing pretty close to the
engines, so it may have sounded like:

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,237
"Notre Dame is gonna get
the ass-kicking they so richly deserve. "

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,159
-Bruno and Hess?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,671
-We stopped a tanker in the Gulf.
-Whose?

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,514
It's Cypress-flagged, but they
tracked them coming out of Qais.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,870
-We think they've got oil?
-Yeah.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,235
-We gonna board them?
-Yeah.

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,113
-Anything else I should know?
-No, sir.

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,790
-I'll see you tomorrow night.
-Have a good flight.

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,150
-Thank you. Hey, C.J.
-Good evening, Mr. President.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,954
-How you doing?
-Very well, sir.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,718
It's great you decided
to make the trip.

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,237
-I believe I was ordered to, Mr. President.
-Yes. I remember now.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,830
-You made one of your funny jokes.
-Yes, sir.

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,029
-Put it on.
-Mr. President.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,032
-Put it on.
-Sir, I'm wearing Max Mara.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,918
-It's gonna break up the--
-Put it on.

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,276
Please let nobody see me like this.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,155
-Hey. Photo-op.
-Oh, good God.

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,837
Let's hit the sky.

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,116
-Did he look tired?
-No, he looked fine.

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,915
-You told him about the tanker?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,520
I wish he 'd canceled the event.
It's a long flight.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,555
He likes long flights. He gets to talk
to everybody and think out loud.

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,629
-Yeah, but then he lands.
-Yeah, so, well, then he lands.

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,791
Anyway, I'm gonna meet
with Matt Skinner.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,678
-T onight?
-Yeah.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,468
He's gonna say the language
in the bill doe'sn't prohibit--

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,558
Yeah, but it creates
a federal definition.

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,672
-Still at the state level--
-Yeah.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,319
Are you sticking around tonight?

70
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,354
The president's gonna have to
make a decision from the plane.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,997
Okay, I have to go.
Donna's about to seize the phone.

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,996
All right.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,596
Leo, he likes long plane rides.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,114
Yeah.

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,675
-Can I have the electricity back on?
-No.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,794
-Why?
-It's time to go.

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,956
Not for me. Skinner's coming
down from the Hill.

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,793
-When did this happen?
-Minutes ago.

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,189
-Did you have plans?
-Did l?

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,869
-Did you?
-Look at me!

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,515
-Hey, you look good.
-Yes, I do.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,473
You weren't wearing that
during the day.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,877
Pity the girl who tries
to get it past you.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,638
-Did you steal that dress?
-I bought it.

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,474
-But you're returning it.
-Yes. I'm giving it back.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,514
-After wearing it once.
-There's a word for this.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,916
It's stealing.

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,032
-I'm on a budget, I'm being thrifty.
-Yes, and felonious.

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,315
-What are your plans?
-Look--

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,193
-What?
-We're having drinks, dinner...

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,869
...dancing, and having dessert.

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,033
You can do all those except for
the drinks, dancing and dessert.

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,316
And you need to be done
with dinner in an hour.

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,875
Do you see what I'm wearing?

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,156
And if you wanna have sex,
do it during dinner.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,037
This is the guy, Josh. This is a
great guy. His name is Todd.

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,874
-You met him for five minutes at a party.
-I got the good vibe.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,635
Okay.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,194
I have an excellent sense.

100
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,188
Actually, you have no sense
about these things.

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,915
You have no vibe.
You have terrible taste in men.

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,873
And your desire to be coupled-up
will always and forever...

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,909
...drown out any small sense of self
or self-worth that you may have.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,756
You're a downer, you know that?

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,475
I'm calling you Deputy Downer
from now on.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,230
Be back by the time
I'm done with Skinner.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,075
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,830
We 're just passing
through 22,000 feet...

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,758
... en route to our cruising altitude
of 38,000 feet.

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,311
Our flight plan this evening will take us
over Pittsburgh and Cleveland...

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,957
...passing 190 miles south of
the University of Notre Dame...

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,752
... then over Rapid City, South Dakota...

113
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,229
-... Casper, Wyoming....
-Toby.

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,909
-Let me see it.
-Can I talk to you?

115
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,559
-ls it done?
-lt' s not.

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,550
-Sam.
-lt' s not good. It's not going well.

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,991
We've had meetings
for the last three weeks.

118
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,276
-I'm not confused about policy.
-What's the problem?

119
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,268
I'm not writing well. I'm just....

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,797
I'd rather not distribute this yet.

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,031
Do you know
what you'd like for dinner?

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,952
We'll be eating in
the conference room.

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,350
I'll have a club sandwich,
Jack Daniel's and ice.

124
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,233
-Mr. Seaborn?
-Nothing for me.

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,751
-You have to have something.
-I'm fine.

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,957
-Bring him a club sandwich.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,512
-Nice hat.
-Shut up.

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,839
Sam and I are gonna work a little.

129
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,799
You'll have draft copies to distribute
in about three hours.

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,554
-lt was already distributed.
-What do you mean?

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,638
-lt was already distributed.
-Get it back.

132
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,712
I can't.
They know you're polishing it.

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,759
-I'm doing more than that.
-I'll tell them there's a new draft.

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,911
-And get the old draft back.
-They're not gonna read it.

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,152
They might. It's bad writing
with my fingerprints all over it.

136
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,989
-Sam!
-C.J., try to get it back. Come on.

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,957
Do you know
what you'd like for dinner?

138
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,475
-Try to get it back.
-Yeah.

139
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,990
Miss Cregg, do you know
what you'd like for dinner?

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,716
-We've got pasta salad?
-It's good.

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,439
I'll take it.

142
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,029
-C.J.
-Mr. President.

143
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,435
What doe's the island of Qais
mean to you?

144
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,872
I know it's known as a rendezvous
point for lraqi oil smugglers.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,675
About two hours ago, we stopped a
Cypress-flagged ship called the Nicosia.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,152
We believe it to be carrying petroleum
out of lraq in violation of U. N. sanctions.

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,990
-What do we do when that happens?
-We board the ship, test the oil...

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,871
...determine its point of origin, and if it's
black market, the company gets fined.

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,350
-Don't they also get to sell the oil?
-Yes.

150
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,950
Doe'sn't the profit from
the sale exceed the fine?

151
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,198
It dramatically exceeds the fine.
So, what do you think we should do?

152
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,030
If you' re gonna have sanctions,
there should be genuine disincentive.

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,997
I agree.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,278
-Charlie?
-Here you go.

155
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,030
-What's this?
-Lyrics to the Notre Dame fight song.

156
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,039
It would please me if you led the press in
a rendition as we pass over South Bend.

157
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,072
-Yes, sir.
-All five verses, please.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,556
-Go, lrish.
-You bet your ass.

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,990
Yes, ma'am?

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,598
Could I have a chocolate chip muffin, a
can of Fresca and a bag of ice, please.

161
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,558
We don't have Fresca.

162
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,479
-Really?
-No, ma'am.

163
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,870
-You should really have Fresca.
-Yes, ma'am.

164
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,632
I'll take a ginger ale.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,954
Ainsley?

166
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,555
-Good evening, Leo.
-What's with the fan?

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,036
I just went and got it
from my apartment.

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,750
-It's 1 7 degrees outside.
-Then I should move my desk outside...

169
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
-...because it's 1 03 in my office.
-The heat's not working?

170
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,428
The heat's working great.
I can vouch for that personally.

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,871
You should really have Fresca
in the building.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,353
I'll get right on that.

173
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,950
-Hey, Matt.
-You let Donna out?

174
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,196
-T emporarily. She's having dinner.
-With who?

175
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,631
-A guy she has no future with.
-Why no future?

176
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,916
Because I say so. You want
coffee or something?

177
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,958
-You got a beer?
-Yeah.

178
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,916
-It's too bad this is gonna be rushed.
-Sorry?

179
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,549
It's too bad we'retalking
about this right now.

180
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,991
-I thought that was by design.
-Really?

181
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,553
-T en days are up tomorrow.
-We know.

182
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,990
We know you know.

183
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,037
The language doe'sn't prohibit
same-sex marriage.

184
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,276
-Of course it doe's.
-For the purposes of federal--

185
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,679
The government will define marriage as
a union between a man and a woman.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,514
While doing nothing to prohibit
gay marriage on a state level.

187
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,429
-Doing nothing to prohibit it?
-lf you look at the language.

188
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,750
Yeah?

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,196
When this bill was being discussed
on the floor...

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,996
...there were some very ugly things
said about homosexuals.

191
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,997
-Yes.
-By members of your own party.

192
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
In fact, by one of the guys
who escorted you here tonight...

193
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,873
-...who's sitting out in the lobby.
-Yes, they were.

194
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,191
-You support this bill?
-Yes, I do.

195
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,630
Congressman...

196
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,599
-...you're gay.
-Yes, I am.

197
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,636
What's going on, Mark?

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,077
The Sudanese captain of the tanker
refused to let naval personnel board.

199
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,510
Oh, man.

200
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,913
A CH-47 Seahawk helicopter was
dispatched from the USS Monterey.

201
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,277
The copter tried to land, but seamen
obstructed the deck with freight.

202
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,994
What else did they do?

203
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,678
-They fired warning shots.
-From what?

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,911
-Russian-made Kalishnakovs.
-AK-47s.

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,437
Yes, at which point the Seahawk
retreated to its carrier group.

206
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,915
Where are we now?

207
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,591
Central Command's gonna have two
F-1 8s buzz the ship, fire warning shots.

208
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,593
There's no way this ends good.
In fact, it's already over.

209
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,038
-It's not over yet.
-Trust me. I'll call the president.

210
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,838
-Yeah?
-You have a phone call.

211
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,593
-From whom?
-Can I just say...

212
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,514
...all I meant was that
if I was married and got divorced...

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,996
...my divorce papers came
and I was an alcoholic...

214
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,958
-...I would want to be--
-Who's on the phone?

215
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,429
The president.

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,113
-Yes, sir.
-What's our goal?

217
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,676
-I'm sorry, sir?
-What are we trying to do?

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,309
We're trying to seize the ship
and escort it to Bahrain.

219
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,751
All right, the F- 18 pilots?

220
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,389
They fire warning shots,
maybe take out the propeller.

221
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,117
Leo, just so they know,
it's a tanker full of crude oil.

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,677
-If they miss and hit something else--
-They know. Excuse me.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,355
Would you stop looking at me like that?

224
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,596
- What was that?
-Margaret was giving me a look.

225
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,273
- Why?
-My divorce papers came today.

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,677
She thinks I'm gonna drink.

227
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,154
I didn't know that.

228
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,877
Don 't worry about it.
I'll keep you posted.

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,876
Why don't I have a final draft
of tomorrow morning's--?

230
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,679
Toby and Sam are working on it.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,434
-What's wrong with it?
-Sam doe'sn 't like the writing.

232
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,030
-Sam wrote it.
-He's taking another swing.

233
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,876
All right.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,035
Read it to me.

235
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,395
" I'm calling on all Americans...

236
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,878
...young and old, Democrat, Republican
or none of the above...

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,753
...to make education a national priority. "

238
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,550
Okay.

239
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,790
" None of the above. "

240
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,354
It's a pedestrian phrase
and has no place.

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,877
Also, was education
not a national priority before?

242
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,110
Right.

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,910
-It's an easy fix, all we need to do is--
-No.

244
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,031
-No, what?
-No, it's not an easy fix.

245
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,997
-This should--
-Yeah?

246
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,029
Oratory should raise your heart rate.

247
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,998
Oratory should blow
the doors off the place.

248
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,154
We should not be satisfied
with past solutions.

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,796
We should be talking about
a permanent revolution.

250
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,955
Where have I heard that?

251
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,395
-Permanent revolution?
-Yeah.

252
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,194
-I got it from a book.
-What book?

253
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,312
The Little Red Book.

254
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,672
You think we should quote
Mao T se-tung?

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,958
-We need a permanent revolution.
-Stay away from quoting Communists.

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,157
You think they never
wrote an elegant phrase?

257
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,035
How do you think they got
everybody to be Communists?

258
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,635
Let's take a walk.

259
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,918
You're the one who's been saying
we need a radical approach--

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,998
Yes. Yes, I have. And I got
shouted down in every meeting.

261
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,788
I'd love to write a speech
about a radical new approach...

262
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,792
...but we don't have one!

263
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,396
So unless we can come up with an idea
and implement it before landing...

264
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,957
...I'd prefer not to paint a picture
in the interest of great oratory.

265
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,029
Let's take a walk.

266
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,310
Can't great oratory inspire an idea?

267
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,832
We had six months.
We're not doing it half-assed.

268
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,030
-Let's go.
-Where?

269
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,959
Up and down the plane.
Get the blood flowing.

270
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,548
-Mao knew how to get the blood flowing.
-Let's go.

271
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,713
-Hey, Donna.
-Good evening.

272
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,951
-That's a nice dress.
-Thank you, sir.

273
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,430
You weren't wearing that dress
earlier today.

274
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,837
You guys are sharp as tacks,
you know that?

275
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,075
-Did you have a date?
-Yeah.

276
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,919
-With who?
-Doe'sn't matter.

277
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,359
-Where'd you eat?
-Phoebe's.

278
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,279
Good. You know what you get there?

279
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,233
You tell the chef that you work for me...

280
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,797
...and that you want the flash-seared
escolar with foie gras butter...

281
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,793
...and a fresh juniper berry gravlax
on a bed of shaved fennel.

282
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,634
You have a nice '87 Petrus with that.

283
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,793
-What'd you have?
-Two whiskey sours and a bowl of soup.

284
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,999
Okay.

285
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,759
-I should tell Josh I'm back.
-He's in the mess.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,718
-Hey, Leo?
-Yeah.

287
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,955
I hope you don't mind.
Margaret mentioned that your divorce--

288
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,874
-Oh, come on.
-That the papers came today and--

289
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,113
She was worried that maybe--

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,552
Margaret worries if the sun is gonna rise.
Go check in with Josh.

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,517
Okay.

292
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,717
-He's in the mess?
-Yeah.

293
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,908
-lt passed.
-I know.

294
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,955
It passed the Senate with 85 votes.
Twenty-nine Democrats voted for it.

295
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,432
It passed the House with 342 votes.
Our numbers are the same as yours.

296
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,430
Sixty percent of Americans oppose
legally sanctioned gay marriage.

297
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,110
The people want the bill,
Congress wants the bill...

298
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,029
...the president needs to sign the bill.

299
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,475
Public opinion can be wrong.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,514
The public opposed interracial marriage
and school integration.

301
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,031
You want me to reach back
into the nostalgia file?

302
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,270
-That's different.
-How?

303
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,031
The government has a responsibility
to protect the rights of minorities...

304
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,799
... but it can't impose the minority's
values on the majority.

305
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,350
Freedom of choice
isn't a minority value...

306
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,917
...just because the majority doe'sn't agree
with the minority's choice.

307
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,995
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

308
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,833
-I'm back.
-Hey, Donna.

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,718
-Hi, congressman.
-How was your date?

310
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,075
It was good.

311
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,636
-Josh, I'll be around.
-Thanks.

312
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,188
Josh, all the Marriage
Recognition Act doe's...

313
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,794
...is ensure that a radical social agenda
isn't thrust upon an entire country...

314
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,273
...that isn't ready for it yet.

315
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,950
32 states have passed laws
banning same-sex marriage.

316
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,319
The states are doing a fine job protecting
themselves without a federal shield.

317
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,070
I like you guys who wanna reduce
the size of government.

318
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,670
Make it just small enough
so it can fit in our bedrooms.

319
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,871
When do you have to call the president?

320
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,473
I've got time.

321
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,312
Let's have another beer.

322
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,192
-How's everybody doing?
-Good.

323
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,029
-Why'd the flight take off so late?
-We took off on time.

324
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,272
No, I mean why was it scheduled late?
I'm doing a sidebar.

325
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,791
The president had
a budget meeting earlier.

326
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,592
Maybe they were expecting it
to run long.

327
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,471
I'd like you to give back the copies
of the speech, we're gonna replace them.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,036
-Why the change?
-Sam is doing some work.

329
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,309
-ls there a policy shift?
-No.

330
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,398
-A new program?
-Just polishing language.

331
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,957
If there's a shift or a new program,
it'd help to have the old text to compare.

332
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,636
There isn't a policy shift, there isn't
a new program, this is Sam being Sam.

333
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,713
Has political pressure from
the NEA forced changes in the--

334
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,558
Nothing's forced changes in the speech.
No policy shifts and no new initiatives.

335
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,798
Carol? Excuse me.

336
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,680
They' re in your press packets.
If you can hand them forward.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,434
He wanted me to tell you
we'reapproaching South Bend...

338
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,354
...and he likes to hear the song
at a brisk and steady tempo.

339
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,911
Oh, kill me now.

340
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,875
Leo?

341
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,238
-Yeah.
-Colonel Chase.

342
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,713
T ell me we didn't hit anything.

343
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,554
No, F-1 8s fired over the bow
and the tanker stopped.

344
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,717
-We boarded?
-Yeah.

345
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,794
But the crew threw the log, the registry
and ship's manifest overboard.

346
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,157
How do these people
think this is gonna end?

347
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,638
I go where you point me.
I'm gonna have to brief Fitzwallace now.

348
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,518
Yeah. Thanks, Mark.

349
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,473
-Margaret?
-Yeah.

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,150
Can you get me
Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill?

351
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,956
And I need Air Force One
the next free minute he's got, okay?

352
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,670
-That's hard to get through Congress.
-Why?

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,434
-Subway money.
-It's a northeastern thing?

354
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,470
Once you get south of D. C. or west
of Chicago, there aren't any subways.

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,877
And the ones they've got,
nobody's using.

356
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,395
What about Miami
and San Francisco? Come in.

357
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,229
L.A., Miami, San Francisco,
maybe someday...

358
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,954
...but nobody's using them now.

359
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,036
-So pavement's gonna win this battle.
-Yes, sir.

360
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,237
-Okay. Thanks, Steve.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

361
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,712
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mike.

362
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,837
-Nice hat.
-Thank you.

363
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,197
Ernesto Perez Balladares.
Former president of Panama.

364
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,156
-You know where he went? Notre Dame.
-Yes, sir. Also Joe Garagiola.

365
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,636
-Was that a crack?
-No, sir.

366
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,872
-You'd like to hear the song now?
-Yeah, but we gotta do it later.

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,152
I'm gonna gauge the impact
on Pacific Rim banking reforms.

368
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,831
A subject economic scholars could
take years on. I will take 20 minutes.

369
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,030
I was asked about
the late departure tonight.

370
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,998
-We left on time.
-The late scheduled departure.

371
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,119
-You don't like late flights?
-I was just repeating--

372
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,916
A long flight across the night.
You know why late flights are good?

373
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,316
Because we cease to be earthbound
and burdened with practicality.

374
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,992
Ask the impertinent question. T alk about
the idea nobody has thought about yet.

375
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,912
Put it a different way.

376
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,071
-Be poets.
-lf you absolutely must.

377
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,510
-T ell Toby.
-Sam--

378
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,478
He doe'sn't wanna use the phrase
" permanent revolution. "

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,910
-ln education?
-Yes.

380
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,437
-Mr. President--
-Mao took a lot of long plane flights.

381
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,032
Look out your window. Is there
anything more romantic than that?

382
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,991
And that's why we left at 9:05?

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,037
No. We left at 9:05 because they thought
my budget meeting might run over.

384
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,715
But wouldn't it have been great
if that was the reason?

385
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,268
Yes.

386
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,195
You don't like "permanent revolution"?

387
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,230
It's a nifty phrase, but I think
if we call for a permanent revolution...

388
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,069
...people are, you know,
gonna expect one.

389
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,874
Mr. President?

390
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,033
We're flying. Live a little.

391
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,196
-Yeah?
-Mr. McGarry.

392
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,555
Leo, just take the damn boat.

393
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,955
Hello?

394
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,872
Is that C.J.?

395
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,314
It's Donna Moss.

396
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,148
Hi.

397
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,556
What happened?

398
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,438
-I can't turn the heat down.
-Did you try?

399
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,190
No, I just looked at the thermostat
and got discouraged.

400
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,591
-Really?
-Of course I tried!

401
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,036
I could grow papayas in here!

402
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,871
-It's a nice office.
-It's the steam pipe distribution venue.

403
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,273
-It's got character.
-I think I'm losing weight.

404
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,155
You wanna come work upstairs
in the bullpen?

405
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,711
-I need to concentrate.
-Nobody's here.

406
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,110
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.
-Okay.

407
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,435
I just came down to say hi.

408
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,439
And I'd talk, but I just--

409
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,477
-I need to get this done.
-I'll leave you alone.

410
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,757
What are you working on?

411
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,717
I'm making notes for Josh.

412
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,759
-lnteresting.
-Yeah.

413
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,594
-The constitutional questions involved.
-Yeah.

414
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,229
-Full Faith and Credit.
-Right.

415
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,957
Do you and I look alike?

416
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,393
-I'm sorry?
-Do we look alike?

417
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,911
-No.
-That's what I thought.

418
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,474
-I didn't think we looked alike.
-Yeah.

419
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,315
Ever thought about dyeing
your hair red? You should.

420
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,875
-Why?
-lt'd look good.

421
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,195
-We don't look alike.
-No.

422
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,039
And I tell people that.

423
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,956
I'm gonna go work upstairs.

424
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,750
I'll see you tomorrow.

425
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,310
I think the alabaster skin
and the farm girl looks--

426
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,796
-You're wigging out, Donna.
-Yes.

427
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,318
You sure you don't want
to work upstairs?

428
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,274
No, it may be hot down here,
but at least it's quiet.

429
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,437
Okay.

430
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,473
Boy, I could use a Fresca.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,877
-You're gonna quote the Bible to me?
-I didn't--

432
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,239
-Really?
-My point, parenthetical at best...

433
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,677
...is that the Founders based the country
on a Judeo-Christian morality...

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,468
...and that the biblical concept
of marriage...

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,151
... maybe can't be separated from the law
quite as easily as you'd like.

436
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,035
The Founding Fathers
made it very clear...

437
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,835
...that they didn't want Judeo-Christian
morality within 1 0 city blocks of the law.

438
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,388
-Matt!
-What?

439
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,878
What?

440
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,909
Nothing.

441
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,038
You understand, gay partners
will be permanently ineligible...

442
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,271
...for survivor benefits,
Medicare, Medicaid--

443
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,439
Which the government can't afford
to pay out anyway.

444
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,871
So we caught a break there.

445
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,798
It's getting pretty late.

446
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,835
I have more notes.

447
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,550
-Carol.
-Yeah.

448
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,440
-Did you get the old drafts back?
-Of the education speech?

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,433
-Yeah.
-Good.

450
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,596
Everybody except Danny.

451
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,268
-Excuse me?
-Danny wanted to keep his.

452
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,993
Excuse me.

453
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,799
-What's the problem?
-How you doing?

454
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,314
What's the problem, Danny?

455
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,070
There's no reason why I should
give you that draft back.

456
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,475
You can't even believe
you're asking for it.

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,911
So unless you're here to give me
a hot towel and cookies--

458
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,549
-Everybody else gave it back.
-They can buy my paper.

459
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,231
I am guaranteeing: No substantive
changes. No new policy initiatives.

460
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,399
You don't have to guarantee me.
I've got the old copy right here.

461
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,119
I hope we don't accidentally send your
luggage to Belgium on the way back.

462
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,598
I wouldn't want to be inconvenienced
by the White House.

463
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,150
-lt was the budget meeting, by the way.
-What's that?

464
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,557
The reason we took off late.

465
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,791
Although there's something to be said....

466
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,989
Something to be said for what?

467
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,476
Nothing.

468
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,031
" I was raised to appreciate the value
of teachers and teaching.

469
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,035
My grandmother, who began her teaching
career in a one-room schoolhouse--"

470
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,396
-Actually, it was two rooms.
-Okay.

471
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,879
Italian stonecutters paid her to teach
their kids English in a rectory basement.

472
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,873
They put up a wall and made it
two rooms as a thank-you gift.

473
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,590
-We'll vote to change it to two rooms.
-I haven't heard the big idea.

474
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,559
-The speech is in pretty good shape now.
-Yeah.

475
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,959
"l began my campaign--" What
happened to 100,000 new teachers?

476
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,832
-No money?
-No teachers.

477
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,754
There aren't 100,000 new teachers.
We can't make people be teachers.

478
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,990
We can give incentives.

479
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,276
In certain districts
there are tax incentives--

480
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,268
-Well, it's not doing the trick.
-No, no. I know.

481
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,995
-But for right now--
-What's that mean?

482
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,433
-I'm sorry?
-What doe's that mean?

483
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,030
-I was scribbling.
-You wrote, "send them to college. "

484
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,997
I was scribbling.

485
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,029
What did you mean,
"send them to college"?

486
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
It's like circling horses in the paper
but not making a bet.

487
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,235
-Tuition incentives.
-Mr. President--

488
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,795
T alk, Charlie.

489
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,469
If this was an idea,
somebody would've had it already.

490
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,228
I find fault with that formula.

491
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,955
-Well....
-What?

492
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,958
The government will send you to college,
law school or medical school...

493
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,714
...if you spend three years
in the armed forces.

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,673
College tuition for anyone
who wants to go to college...

495
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,195
...in exchange for they teach
in a public school.

496
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,278
Why can't that idea be floated?

497
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,950
-Doe's anybody know how we pay for it?
-That comes next.

498
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,714
Yes, it doe's come next.
So why don't we--?

499
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,399
Kick this around.

500
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,150
-Mr. President, the time--
-I'll be in my study.

501
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,835
It's an incredible sky tonight.

502
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,588
This is Colonel Beech
from the flight deck.

503
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,471
We 're told there 's choppy wind ahead
and are cleared to climb to 42,000 feet.

504
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,719
-57% of the people--
-I know what 57% of the people say.

505
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,715
What 58% of them say is that gay
spouses should receive health benefits...

506
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,156
...and 54% say
social security benefits...

507
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,796
...and we haven't talked
about the 1 4th Amendment.

508
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,150
A strict interpretation
of the Equal Protection clause...

509
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,910
...would dictate that homophobia
can't be made into a law.

510
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,958
That's for the court to decide,
but they'll uphold it.

511
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,034
-Laurence T ribe disagrees with you.
-He doe'sn't sit on the Supreme Court.

512
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,557
-Five justices!
-Josh, I came here as a friend...

513
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,869
...and I think you know that.
I came here because I came here.

514
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,957
Look, this is gonna be a law
whether the president vetoes or not.

515
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,953
-They have the votes in the Senate--
-Senate's not in session.

516
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,032
The president can stick this
in his pants pocket.

517
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,033
And it will come back in January, and
you will have to live through this twice...

518
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,634
...and you will lose both times.

519
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,790
Ask me the question.

520
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,079
He compared homosexuality to
kleptomania and sex addiction.

521
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,239
-The leader of your own party.
-He was wrong and I told him so.

522
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,193
-For crying out loud!
-Ask me the question!

523
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,837
How can you be a member of this party?

524
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,350
You've been holding that in
for way too long.

525
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,192
This party that says
who you are is against the law.

526
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,915
You know, I never understood why you
gun control people don't all join the NRA.

527
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,396
They've got 2 million members,
you bring 3 million to the next meeting.

528
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,196
Call a vote. All those in favor
of tossing guns:

529
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,358
Bam, move on.

530
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,917
It's a heck of a strategy, Matt,
I'll bring that up at a meeting.

531
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,112
I agree with 95 percent
of the Republican platform.

532
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,914
I believe in local government.

533
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,032
I'm in favor of individual rights
rather than group rights.

534
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,715
I believe free markets
lead to free people...

535
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,474
...and that the country needs
a strong national defense.

536
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,999
My life doe'sn't have to be
about being a homosexual.

537
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,189
It doe'sn't have to be entirely about that.

538
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,392
Thanks for coming by.

539
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,479
Thanks for the beer.

540
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,194
There he is.

541
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,511
-How did it go?
-He'll sign it.

542
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,829
-I can tell McDougal?
-Yeah.

543
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,635
-Good job, congressman.
-Take your hand off my shoulder.

544
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,995
The speech is fine now.

545
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,915
-100,000 college scholarships?
-You wanted me?

546
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,917
We might float
an education initiative.

547
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,992
-I just told them--
-We're not floating.

548
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,517
We might float, I'm saying,
and you should give them heads-up.

549
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,679
Excuse me,
I need to go look like an idiot.

550
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,871
We're not floating
a policy initiative, Sam.

551
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,668
I don't care if it's a trip
to the moon on gossamer wings.

552
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,911
It's pie-in-the-sky
to say nothing of patronizing...

553
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,789
...to have privileged lvy Leaguers play
teacher to America's vulnerable children.

554
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,078
The people taking advantage of this
aren't gonna be overprivileged.

555
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,988
How will the T eachers Union feel?

556
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,312
-They'll have 100,000 new members.
-Who will leave after three years.

557
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,239
-The kids will be abandoned.
-They won't.

558
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,716
-Their teachers will leave!
-ln the fifth grade...

559
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,395
...what do you care what
your fourth-grade teacher's doing?

560
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,990
-Sam.
-Toby.

561
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,594
They're gonna be role models...

562
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,753
...to kids who don't have contact
with young college graduates...

563
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,310
...many of whom grew up
in neighborhoods like theirs.

564
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,716
-We could--
-Sam!

565
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,598
Where are we getting the money?

566
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,916
Where are we getting the money?

567
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,519
I was really mortified
that I froze up on that speech.

568
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,116
Yeah.

569
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,351
You should've told me a few days ago.

570
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,915
Yeah.

571
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,988
I play the flute.

572
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,432
I'm a flautist.

573
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,919
In high school
I was the best in my row.

574
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,589
And so I ask myself, if I'd pursued
the flute professionally...

575
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,036
...would I be meeting interesting men?

576
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,918
And the answer comes back to me:

577
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,633
Probably not.

578
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,239
I played the trombone.

579
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,228
-Did you meet interesting men?
-Yeah.

580
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,435
Is it a hard instrument to learn?
If I took it up now--

581
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,589
T alk to me about
the Full Faith and Credit clause.

582
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,992
It says that full faith and credit
shall be given by each state...

583
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,476
...to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of every other state.

584
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,037
If you' re married in Maryland,
it's gotta be recognized by Nebraska.

585
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,794
How is the Marriage Recognition Act
not unconstitutional?

586
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,270
Because it also says
that Congress can prescribe...

587
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,234
...the manner in which
such acts and records are proved.

588
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,398
They can decide
what being married means...

589
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,194
...within the context of Article lV.

590
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,870
Josh? Toby.

591
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,916
-Yeah.
-What's going on?

592
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,395
-I'm gonna tell him to sign it.
-Okay.

593
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,832
-How's his mood?
-He's frustrated. He's feeling--

594
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,555
You know when he goes off on a thing,
Toby, he expects you to bring him in.

595
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,680
He wants you to do it
so he doe'sn 't have to do it himself.

596
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,998
Josh, what do you think
about tuition incentives for--?

597
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,719
Ladies and gentlemen.

598
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,237
We 're 82 miles south of the runway
and beginning our initial descent.

599
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,796
If I could ask you all to find seats.
Thank you.

600
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,319
What was that?

601
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,398
-We're landing.
-No, what were you gonna--?

602
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,955
Nothing.

603
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,036
All right, I'll talk to you later.

604
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,113
I'm gonna talk to Leo.

605
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,755
I'll see you guys Monday.

606
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,593
-Good night.
-Take it easy.

607
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,071
Did you know
she played the trombone?

608
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,476
I didn't.

609
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,156
T onight stunk, Josh.

610
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,194
I'm sorry about that.

611
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,917
I didn't mean having to work, although
that was a treat. I meant the guy.

612
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,918
-Who was he?
-A lobbyist with Travis-West.

613
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,549
He was pretty full of himself
and without cause to be.

614
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,116
An obnoxious insurance lobbyist?
What were the odds?

615
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,278
It isn't funny, Josh.

616
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,315
-I've gotta go see Leo.
-I'll call you in the morning.

617
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,396
You look really great
in that dress tonight, Donna.

618
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,035
You should buy it for yourself.

619
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,513
Yeah.

620
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,916
Yeah.

621
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,473
We hold the ship in Bahrain--

622
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,468
It doe'sn 't do anything
to hold the ship in Bahrain.

623
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,028
We hold the ship in Bahrain and send
a sample to the U.S. Customs lab.

624
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,750
-lf the point of origin violates sanctions--
-You know what's gonna happen?

625
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,239
They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly
port. 780,000 metric tons of gas oil...

626
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,149
...against a $2 million fine
for the oil company...

627
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,035
... which their profits
from the sale will cover.

628
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,596
We 're not providing much of
a disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions.

629
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,239
What else is there to do?

630
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,237
If we 're gonna have sanctions at all,
we should make them stick.

631
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,955
We should confiscate the cargo,
seize the ship...

632
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,993
...sell the oil and use the money
to beef up anti-smuggling operations.

633
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,551
You don't mean tonight,
you mean in the future.

634
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,838
We're landing, Mr. President.

635
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,035
Yeah. In the future.

636
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,793
Okay.

637
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,270
-Josh wants to talk about the--
-Hang on.

638
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,556
-You need me?
-I can wait.

639
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,277
-Yeah.
-The Marriage Recognition Act.

640
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,795
Yeah.

641
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,278
We'll be landing in just a few minutes.
Follow the blue signs to your bus.

642
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,313
Oh, one thing before we land.

643
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,994
When I said there'd be no policy shifts or
new initiatives in the speech tomorrow...

644
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,148
...that was correct except there
might be a policy shift or new initiative.

645
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,996
-There isn't gonna be a change.
-Toby!

646
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,590
-There isn't gonna be a change. Danny.
-He's not gonna give it back.

647
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,629
Danny, Sam choked hard
on the last draft and wants to burn it.

648
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,515
-No problem.
-No problem?

649
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,156
T ell him to relax,
he'll get his swing back.

650
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,875
-T ell him I didn't read it.
-Thanks.

651
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,996
-You were just having a little go at me.
-Yeah, it's a long flight.

652
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,437
-So you decided to kill time by--
-Yeah, you know why?

653
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,234
Tell me you went to Notre Dame.

654
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,309
Maybe next time you won't be so quick
to mock on the eve of a Michigan game.

655
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,991
There must be an escape hatch here
of some kind.

656
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,231
The constitutional argument--

657
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,036
I don 't care about the constitutional
argument, Josh, it's gay bashing.

658
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,630
It's legislative gay bashing.
How do I put my name on it?

659
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,712
I wouldn't, sir.

660
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,195
I'd put it away.

661
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,188
A pocket veto's a politician's way out.

662
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,917
They'll send it again
when they're in session.

663
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,800
Meanwhile we focus on the
Employment Nondiscrimination Act.

664
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,351
If I'm gonna sign it in January,
why am I vetoing it now?

665
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,839
A symbolic gesture
to the gay community.

666
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,959
I'm sure the gay community
can't wait to thank me.

667
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,916
-Mr. President?
- This is just wrong.

668
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,877
Yeah.

669
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,637
You can look at the polling numbers,
Article IV and social security benefits.

670
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,154
It doe'sn 't matter, it's just wrong.

671
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,878
We shouldn't be defining love, and we
certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it.

672
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,395
It's wrong. This is the job--

673
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,354
-It's the job of somebody else.
-Well, right now it's ours.

674
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,949
-It's wrong.
-Sir.

675
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,636
I should get out a rubber stamp that
says, "Josiah Bartlet votes no. "

676
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
It's exactly what the conservatives
are hoping you'll do.

677
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,917
I should get out a rubber stamp!

678
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,830
-Sir?
-Put it in a drawer.

679
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,029
Yes, sir.

680
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,869
Thank you, Mr. President.

681
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,275
We'll talk at the hotel.

682
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,996
Okay.

683
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,990
All right.

684
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,154
-Have a good night.
-You too.

685
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,999
Hey, Leo, Margaret mentioned--

686
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,639
-Come on, Josh.
-No, she just said--

687
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,520
My divorce papers came today.
She thinks I'm gonna drink.

688
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,997
Sounds like a pretty good reason to.

689
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,754
I'm an alcoholic.
I don't need a good reason to.

690
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,871
You want to have coffee someplace?

691
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,315
I wanna go home.

692
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,628
-Okay.
-I'll see you on Monday.

693
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,153
Margaret, I'm going.

694
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,753
Okay.

695
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,713
You're a good girl.

696
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,115
Okay.

697
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,952
-Sir?
-Yeah.

698
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,955
-You're off the phone?
-Yeah.

699
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,553
There was a question?

700
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,395
For a sidebar on the game tomorrow.

701
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,956
-Why did you go to Notre Dame?
-Why not?

702
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,719
Bearing in mind I'm just repeating
someone else's question...

703
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,190
...you were accepted at Harvard,
Yale and Williams.

704
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,948
Why did you go to Notre Dame?

705
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,748
Because I was thinking
about becoming a priest.

706
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,791
-Really?
-Yeah.

707
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,194
What happened?

708
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,711
I met Abbey.

709
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,237
Why can't you give me answers like that
when we'rerunning for something?

710
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,354
-Because I like to bother you.
-Well, I shall not be defeated.

711
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,472
-Sit down.
-Okay.

712
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,876
-Mr. President.
-Toby.

713
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,752
Here's a final draft.

714
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,629
Toby, you should sit down. We're
landing in a minute and 1 0 seconds.

715
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,870
How do you know that?

716
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,794
I set my watch to the cockpit computer.

717
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,394
You should sit down.

718
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,035
Thank you.

719
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,917
Do you know why the assistant
energy secretary is on the plane?

720
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,753
-You have a meeting with him.
-That's right.

721
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,876
I think Charlie's idea was a good one.

722
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,555
I think you should ask Leo
to put together a team...

723
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,311
...to study the feasibility
of appropriations...

724
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,434
...for a pilot program with 100 teachers.

725
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,353
They' re taking the tanker to Bahrain,
and the company's gonna make a profit.

726
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,876
Yes, sir.

727
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,476
The Marriage Recognition Act
is gonna be law.

728
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,955
Yes, sir.

729
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,989
-A hundred new teachers?
-Yeah.

730
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,110
Instead of 100,000?

731
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,709
Yeah.

732
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,997
Well, it's a start I guess.

733
