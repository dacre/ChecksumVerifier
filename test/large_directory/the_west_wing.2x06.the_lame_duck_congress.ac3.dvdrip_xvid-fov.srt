00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,755
Previously on The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,469
-You're Aimsley Hayes.
-Ainsley, with an N.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,671
-I'm offering her a job.
-Where?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,428
-My day's had a great start.
-It's about to get better.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,272
-Who is this?
-Ainsley Hayes.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,193
-You're an idiot.
-It's not that she's Republican.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,750
She's a Republican woman
and good-looking.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,759
Those three things in combination
usually spell careerism.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,235
If I have to endure
another disappointment today...

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,670
...from this place, I am gonna lose it.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,918
-1 7 seconds it took her to call us liars.
-Keep your voice down.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,270
-What are you doing here?
-Serving my country.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,238
-ls he meeting with McNally?
-No.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,869
Mr. Konanov, while he is here...

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,989
... is not meeting with the secretary
of state or any Cabinet-level official.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,397
He's not meeting with the U. N.
ambassador or any NAT O allies.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,159
He's not meeting
with the president.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,598
He will be meeting with the
president's advisors on the Balkans.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,029
Who's next?

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,790
Senator-elect Morgan Mitchel is going
to announce on Hardball later today...

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,594
... he'll seek a seat on the
Foreign Relations Committee...

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,475
...and prevent the T est Ban T reaty
from coming to the floor. Any thoughts?

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,876
We'll have a ratified
comprehensive T est Ban T reaty.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,639
Mitchel says over his dead body.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,798
Senator-elect Mitchel will discover
that he is one of 100...

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,594
...and that his power is more limited
than he imagines.

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,836
The new Senate will ratify the treaty...

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,395
...and we don't care
what condition his body is in.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,351
Danny.

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,149
Has the president considered
ordering a lame-duck session...

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,755
...for the Senate to vote?

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,918
-Anybody but Danny?
-He hasn't considered it?

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,430
I don't know every thought
that passes through his head...

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,995
... but there have been no discussions
that I'm aware of.

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,955
I'd like to know. Is that something you
can check out and get back to us on?

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,395
You bet. Who's next?

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,552
She walked into it.
She knows it too.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,955
Walked into what?

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,279
She can't confirm that the president
hasn't considered it unless she asks...

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,233
-...at which point he'll consider it.
-That sounds pretty stupid.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,950
It was a better-organized thought
in my head.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,559
-She's wrapping up.
-Let's go.

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,909
-Has he considered it?
-No.

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,189
-Why not?
-Why should he?

45
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,790
-lf he has a better chance of ratification--
-He doe'sn't.

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,593
-But if Mitchel--
-He's not a factor.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,075
The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration--

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,351
-OSHA--
-How do you change subjects so fast?

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,155
How do you go from a T est Ban T reaty
and a lame-duck Congress to OSHA?

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,950
Because I'm me. Do you know how many
people acquire carpal tunnel syndrome?

51
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,992
It shouldn't surprise you that I do not.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,919
600,000 Americans a year.
Do you know how painful it is?

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,191
In the scheme of things,
who really cares if--

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,516
-Do you have any idea?
-Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,268
Pain in your forearm. No grip.
You lose the ability to pinch.

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,309
People who lose the ability to pinch,
I don't know how they can go on.

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,836
-You guys are wrong on this.
-Aren't you one of "you guys"?

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,991
Not on this.

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,515
-I know.
-You walked into it.

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,473
There was no other direction to walk.
Answer "no" to this question:

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,632
-Has the president considered it?
-No.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,229
-Good.
-Listen. Not that I know of.

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,669
-He hasn't.
-Listen.

64
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,157
He should consider it.
He should consider it right now.

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,874
There isn't a seat open
on Foreign Relations for Mitchel.

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,032
-There is on Appropriations.
-Kasey'll move?

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,430
What's going on?

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,029
-Kasey wants Appropriations.
-He'll have to give up Budget.

69
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,069
T aglio'll jump at it, clearing the way
for Newberry in Senate Armed Services.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,516
Newberry leaving opens up Judiciary.

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,109
Who wants to be attorney general
under the next president?

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,272
-Howard Westin.
-So he takes the Judiciary seat.

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,876
Vacating his seat on Foreign Relations.

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,475
So there's a seat open.

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,877
-lt doe'sn't mean Mitchel's gonna get it.
-Yes, it doe's.

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,315
-Why?
-Nobody else wants it.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,828
-Why?
-There's no money in it.

78
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,839
The Foreign Relations Committee
has no control over money.

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,031
So there's no lobbyists.
So no fundraisers.

80
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,632
-Under extraordinary circumstances--
-It's vital to national and global security.

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,434
-What did you have in mind?
-These people--

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,790
Do we have less of a chance
with a new Congress?

83
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,752
We have no chance
with a new Congress.

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,273
While I've never lived through a
nuclear explosion, I've seen pictures.

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,997
I agree with Josh on his interpretation of
the extraordinary-circumstances clause.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,595
-ls Leo free now?
-ln five minutes.

87
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,348
These people are gone.
The 1 06th Congress is adjourned.

88
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,312
Twelve were voted out of office.
This is bad.

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,076
T ell the president to call a lame-duck
session, it's gonna look like politics.

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,676
It is politics.
Let's see Leo.

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,110
What do we tell the 1 2 people
looking for new jobs?

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,073
They may not be done
with their old ones yet.

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,075
Kasey wants Appropriations.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,590
-He's on Budget.
-He's gonna want Appropriations.

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,950
-Kasey wants Appropriations.
-He has seniority.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,832
-He'll give up Budget.
-T aglio'll take that.

97
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,912
Clearing the way for Newberry
in Armed Services.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,953
-He'll vacate his seat on Judiciary.
-Westin leaves Foreign Relations.

99
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,673
That's where Mitchel comes in.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,350
It's like running the country with
Barnum, Bailey and his sister Sue.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,112
Leo, would it be possible
for just two of them to speak at once?

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,594
Toby?

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,992
That was an hour-and-1 0-minute
meeting...

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,869
...with Dick Rush, Ed,
Marty Beach and Henry Rodriguez.

105
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,994
I have never seen political and legislative
liaisons so unanimous in a diagnosis.

106
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,636
-They think he should call it?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,717
We have a better chance now
than in a month.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,433
Not only that--
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,869
Toby?

110
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,435
Not only that, here's what
C.J. can tell the press.

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,109
The world is looking to the U.S.
to ratify the treaty first.

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,830
We wait, it takes longer for
other countries to ratify...

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,159
...the closer we get to more unstable
countries developing a nuclear threat.

114
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,512
-Arguments against?
-We might lose the vote.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,754
-That'll hang around our necks.
-The Senate might stall confirmations.

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,191
Can I add that a Senator-elect
announcing what assignment he'd like...

117
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,870
...is not what the founders would have
considered an extraordinary occasion.

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,311
An extraordinary occasion is whatever
the president says it is.

119
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,473
Charlie!

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,792
-Sir?
-Could I have a couple of aspirin...

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,719
...or a weapon of some kind
to kill people with?

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,195
-Leo?
-Even when they' re here in session...

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,790
...getting 100 Senators in a line is
like getting cats to walk in a parade.

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,433
What do you wanna do?

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,673
Take the leadership's temperature
on the lame-duck session...

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,918
...and let's also get some kind of nose
count and see where we are.

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,430
Leak it the president's considering
calling the Senate back.

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,835
That is not gonna be a problem.

129
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,276
The source is big enough
so they go with it...

130
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,836
...small enough so we're not tied to it.
Toby, get me a nose count. What else?

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,709
The State Department wants
to change the terminology...

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,991
...from " rogue nations"
to "states of concern. "

133
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,430
-What else?
-Medicare coverage of clinical trials.

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,950
-What else?
-Fraud awareness for small businesses.

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,390
Not now. Anything else?

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,875
The four of you wait in my office.

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,874
Thank you all.

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,591
-When doe's Konanov get here?
-ln a few minutes.

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,518
-No high-level meetings, right?
-No.

140
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,310
-On the lame-duck session.
-Yeah?

141
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,195
-You don't want to call a vote and lose.
-Yeah, but this could be a window.

142
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,349
-We've gotta see if it's doable.
-Yeah.

143
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,234
-lt could be doable.
-Yeah.

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,834
-You got anything more to say?
-Not this minute.

145
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,270
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Thank you.

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,394
There's gonna be an editorial
in The Post tomorrow.

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,592
The president's time
isn't being used efficiently.

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,440
Schedules are abandoned before lunch.

149
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,951
The west wing resembles
a high school yearbook office.

150
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,113
And I believe I'm compared
to a substitute teacher.

151
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,953
-That's ridiculous.
-No, it's not.

152
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,115
Certainly not based on the display
I just saw in there. So new rules.

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,070
You need an answer from the president,
you want him to weigh in...

154
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,996
...I want to see a summary on my desk
absolutely no longer than two pages...

155
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,074
...and I want my initials on it
before you go into the Oval Office.

156
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,199
A two-page summary's
gonna kind of cramp our style, isn't it?

157
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,989
Your style could use a little cramping.
Are we understood?

158
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,390
-Yes.
-Fine.

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,910
Toby, Sam, take some meetings
on the Hill today.

160
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,112
Toby, concentrate on votes that can
be loosened with Stenson gone.

161
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,870
Sam, dangle reservations
in front of them. C.J., start the leak.

162
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,318
Anybody happens to see
Vasily Konanov in the hallways...

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,989
...walk in the other direction. That's it.

164
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,389
I can't unleash my potential
in a two-page summary.

165
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,797
I'm gonna meet with Fox and Fowler,
Sam, you're gonna go to the Hill.

166
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,069
Think with Stenson gone?

167
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,510
I can get Fox and Fowler
to loosen up some votes.

168
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,473
That is, if I can ever get them
to order off the damn menu.

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,235
I've never seen two grown men
order lunch like this.

170
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,149
Fox and Fowler loosen the votes. Sam,
you drop that we'd consider reservations.

171
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,632
It is not out of the realm of possibility
that that gets us eight votes.

172
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,036
They wanna speak to the president,
he's by the phone.

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,469
So this is not unimportant.

174
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,309
I also have to take a 22-page position
memo and summarize it in two pages...

175
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,155
-...and it's gotta be done today.
-Give it to Ainsley.

176
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,993
-She's gonna--
-Get over it.

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,430
There are gonna be jokes
because I asked her for help.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,995
"Reservations. " That's the word
you're dropping on the Hill.

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,710
You don't have to leave
the meeting with a win.

180
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,835
Let's be able to end this day
by telling the president...

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,596
...he's in striking distance and he should
seriously consider the session.

182
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,949
Let's be able to do that.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,230
Where's C.J.?

184
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,034
She's looking for a reporter
to leak the story to.

185
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,033
-You talk to him?
-I don't believe it.

186
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,670
You guys launched an editorial.
Four in two weeks.

187
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,110
-I don't work for the editorial staff.
-That's convenient.

188
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,994
-You expect me to do nothing?
-Are you gonna cancel your subscription?

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,475
-Smack me around?
-Any reason I can't do both?

190
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,995
-Hey, Carol.
-Hey.

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,753
Carol, get me the spokesperson
for the majority leader.

192
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,553
-House or Senate?
-Senate.

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,876
So you guys are considering
a lame-duck session.

194
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,920
-Who says?
-You're calling the majority leader.

195
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,794
We do a great deal of business
with the majority leader.

196
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,116
-He's not in session.
-They'll track him down.

197
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,870
Can I say "White House senior aides"?
"High-level sources in the White House"?

198
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,515
"Sources in the White House
office of legislative liaisons...

199
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,916
-...who declined to be named. "
-lt sounds like I got it from a paperboy.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,679
-Take it or leave it.
-I'll take it.

201
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,279
Anything else?

202
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,192
-Nope.
-Thank you.

203
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,349
-Ken Richmond on line three.
-Who is he?

204
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,756
He's the spokesperson
for the majority leader.

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,395
-I didn't need him.
-Ken, sorry....

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,592
What I think you don't understand...

207
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,034
...is carpal tunnel is only one of many
repetitive stress injuries, or RSl...

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,470
...which are covered by
the science of ergonomics.

209
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,035
I'm not in charge of
the science of ergonomics.

210
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,750
You're gonna have to ask
somebody else who cares.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,871
You don't have to be in charge.
OSHA is.

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,709
I want to know why the White House
isn't implementing their new standards.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,835
Because the SBA says that the cost
could exceed $1 8 billion a year...

214
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,192
...there'll be a huge increase in
workmen's compensation premiums...

215
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,948
...and Republicans find the word
"ergonomic" to be silly.

216
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,954
If we backed off everything
because the words are silly...

217
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,878
...we'd have pregnant teenagers
and no health care.

218
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,476
We do have pregnant teenagers
and no health care.

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,193
So how's your plan
working out so far?

220
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,999
-Josh?
-Hang on, Charlie.

221
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,759
-I don't think this can wait.
-What?

222
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,029
Vasily Konanov is here.

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,833
I can't see him.
Make sure he's not in the bullpen.

224
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,912
He's not.
He's in the driveway.

225
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,470
-What?
-He's sitting in the car in the driveway.

226
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,193
He's refusing to get out unless
he can speak to the president.

227
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,874
-This is a joke?
-No.

228
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,515
-He's sitting in the driveway?
-They're saying....

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,155
-What?
-They're saying he's drunk.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,433
-Really?
-Yeah.

231
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,914
Okay.

232
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,269
Okay.

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,355
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

234
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,914
-This is your office?
-Yes.

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,679
-It's very nice, Sam.
-Thank you.

236
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,918
You can see sunlight and you have
a window that can be opened.

237
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,315
You want to work or decorate?

238
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,272
-You called me?
-Yes. I need your help.

239
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,716
-Really?
-Let's not make a big deal out of it.

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,718
No, it's sweet that you need my help.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,911
I don't need your help,
I'm asking for it.

242
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,714
Dad, it's me.
Sam's asking for my help.

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,719
-Put the phone down.
-Gotta go, Dad, I need to help Sam.

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,992
-You must've had them rolling in Georgia.
-I'm from North Carolina.

245
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,953
-Wherever you studied baton-twirling.
-Harvard Law School.

246
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,912
Yes. So here's the thing.

247
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,838
-You need my help.
-A favor.

248
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,792
I have a position recommendation...

249
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,036
...regarding an amendment
to a commerce bill.

250
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,914
It's 22 pages long and
Leo is on a streamlining kick.

251
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
You want me to summarize it
and give it to the president?

252
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,953
Yeah, and then I want you to skip
to Tijuana in a dirndl skirt.

253
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,470
-Summarize it and give it to me.
-Fine.

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,399
Thank you.

255
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,272
-ln exchange for?
-No.

256
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,716
-Then my schedule's tight.
-ln exchange for what?

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,275
Are you going to the Hill for meetings
on the T est Ban Treaty?

258
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,231
-I want to go.
-No.

259
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,914
-Why?
-Because.

260
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,039
I'm not gonna say anything,
I'm not gonna spill anything...

261
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,590
... I'm not gonna get
Republican juice on you.

262
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,996
-I'm just gonna sit there and learn.
-Look--

263
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,717
From the master, Sam.
I wanna learn from the master.

264
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,868
You see, women think
that kind of thing works, but it doe'sn't.

265
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,469
It really doe's, Sam.

266
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,756
I let you come,
you'll summarize my memo?

267
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,838
I'll use punctuation and everything.
You might get extra credit.

268
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,075
Have you eaten lunch?

269
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,669
I brought my lunch from home.
I ate it already.

270
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,554
Did you bring your lunch?
Do you think you'll be eating it?

271
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,034
-You can't have my lunch.
-Okay.

272
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,988
-Meet me in the lobby in an hour.
-Okay.

273
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,949
-I'm helping her out.
-Good.

274
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,708
-She wants to get a feel for--
-We've got a problem.

275
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,598
-Konanov.
-ls he here?

276
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,438
In a manner of speaking.

277
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,993
-Leo?
-Yeah.

278
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,111
-How you doing?
-Good.

279
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,436
Vasily Konanov is in the driveway.

280
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,110
He's drunk and he won't get out of
the car until he speaks to the president.

281
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,670
-And we have a winner.
-Are you kidding me?

282
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,635
He's sitting in the car with a woman who
is either a security attaché or a hooker.

283
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,115
-Please tell me it's not--
-It's no one you know.

284
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,311
-Have you spoken to him?
-I'm not allowed to.

285
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,670
I walked by the car a couple of times.

286
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,475
Leo, we gotta move him. T ourists
are gonna start to ask questions...

287
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,113
...and Boris and Natasha
will answer them.

288
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,079
You now have permission
to talk to him.

289
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,633
Put him in an office, dry him out, and
explain why he can't see the president.

290
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,635
-T ry to avoid the Situation Room.
-Good safety tip.

291
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,830
-What?
-I'm taking Ainsley to the Hill with me.

292
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,190
-Good.
-She wants me to teach her some things.

293
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,789
-She called me the master.
-Get out.

294
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,193
Yeah, the risotto, but I'd like it cooked
with chicken broth instead of oil.

295
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,869
And I'd like to substitute
the snow peas for the asparagus.

296
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,557
I'll have the same, but I don't want
the squash puréed with cream or butter.

297
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,831
-ln fact, doe's it even have to be puréed?
-Fellas?

298
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,357
-Just asking.
-It's puréed. Otherwise, it's just squash.

299
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,514
Butter is fine.

300
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,916
I'll have a New York steak
and ginger ale. Just cook it.

301
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,149
-The rumor's been getting around.
-ls it more than a rumor?

302
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,595
We don't know yet.

303
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,348
-Our boss is fishing off the Keys.
-Everybody's boss is.

304
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,591
Or skiing in Jackson Hole
or watching football.

305
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,996
It'll tear the president up
to bring them back...

306
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,759
... but I want to talk about if he should.

307
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,996
-Our guy's not gonna vote to ratify.
-Why not?

308
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,838
-Same reason as before.
-We didn't have a vote.

309
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,514
-Because you'd lose.
-Right.

310
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,471
What are you saying?

311
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,032
I'm saying, what if there was
a vote now? Without Stenson.

312
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,515
Stenson wasn't keeping us
from voting for it.

313
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,994
-What was?
-The voters.

314
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,869
-82% want the T est Ban T reaty.
-Not in our state.

315
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,318
-You were guided by the 1 8%--
-Not in our state, Toby.

316
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,559
82% of voters, Joe. 82% of voters,
to say nothing of 1 50 nations...

317
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,991
...including Russia, China,
Great Britain, France.

318
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,552
Get North Korea, lndia and Pakistan
aboard, and we'll have a ball game.

319
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,831
-Have you checked your back yard?
-What?

320
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,390
-Have you checked your back yard?
-What do you...?

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,990
In the nose count. I don't think you have
the votes you think you have.

322
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,475
-Who did we lose?
-Make your calls.

323
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,352
I don't have to make--

324
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
-Who did we lose?
-Make your calls, Toby.

325
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,873
-Did you say you wanted--?
-Chicken broth instead of oil.

326
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,469
-Snow peas instead of the asparagus.
-Excuse me.

327
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,753
-I don't understand.
-lt happens.

328
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,508
A member of the Ukrainian
Parliament can just show up?

329
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,955
He had an appointment,
just not with the president.

330
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,590
-The guy's a little crazy, Leo.
-No, he's just....

331
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,110
Yeah, he's crazy,
but he's our kind of crazy.

332
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,389
-Got it.
-Good.

333
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,193
-The girl's not bad-looking.
-Go to work.

334
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,875
-You think she knows how to kill me?
-Yes.

335
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,869
-Leo.
-Hey, Donna.

336
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,515
-Can I talk to you for a moment?
-Sure.

337
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,951
-That's a very nice suit. Is it new?
-No, what's on your mind?

338
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,949
OSHA would like to do something
about repetitive stress injuries...

339
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,629
...or musculoskeletal disorders
like tendinitis or--

340
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,833
-Or carpal tunnel syndrome.
-One interesting example out of several--

341
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,113
We can't afford it. It costs
$1 8 billion, Donna. Type slower.

342
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,719
C.J., what do you got?

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,877
The State Department
and our new vocabulary.

344
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,957
Is this the two- or 1 0-minute pitch?

345
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,878
-The two-minute pitch.
-Go.

346
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,998
-Now you threw me off my game.
-C.J.

347
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,395
-I'm nervous now.
-Come on.

348
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,831
-lf I run over, you're gonna play me off.
-I'm getting older over here, C.J.

349
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,278
State wants us to change
"rogue nations" to "states of concern. "

350
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,120
I say fine. It's a symbolic gesture
with no real consequence.

351
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,512
It gains us points with allies
who feel we've been too harsh.

352
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,918
It signals to countries we'retalking about
that we'reopen to taking positive steps.

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,311
-Any downside?
-I'll feel stupid.

354
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,272
-I can live with that.
-You have so far.

355
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,910
T alk to the president
at the end of the day.

356
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,510
-Sure. About what?
-Danny wants access for a feature.

357
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,869
-No.
-No, what?

358
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,509
No, he can't have access.

359
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,476
Leo, his editorial staff just jumped on
your head yesterday and last Thursday.

360
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,916
The president twice before.
Four times in two weeks.

361
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,589
That's why everybody's
walking around with a stopwatch.

362
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,237
T alk to the president at the end of the
day. You'll get another two minutes.

363
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,750
Hello?

364
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,990
We may be dead already.

365
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,633
-What happened?
-We lost someone.

366
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,399
-Who?
-I don't know.

367
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,035
I need some help.
Is T ony Marino in Philadelphia?

368
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,954
-I don't know.
-Call him and see if he'd get on a train.

369
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,431
I wanna find out who we lost
and get them back.

370
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,914
Back up.

371
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,032
-We lost one of our people.
-Who?

372
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,829
-They wouldn't tell me.
-Fox and Fowler--

373
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,078
They wouldn't tell me.
They just said to check our back yard.

374
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,590
-Who the hell--?
-I need to talk to Marino.

375
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,871
It's not hard enough getting new votes?

376
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,513
I need you to talk to Marino.

377
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,472
I need you to set up
a meeting with me.

378
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,430
He needs to tell me who jumped
and he needs to help us bring them back.

379
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,119
Toby, the guy lost a bad race bloody.

380
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,273
-He's gonna wanna come back for this.
-He's gonna wanna sit down.

381
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,910
Not on the T est Ban Treaty.
He spent four years on it.

382
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,517
Spent a lot longer than that,
and it burned him. He lost his seat.

383
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,995
-The man's done.
-Obviously, he hasn't.

384
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,389
I set up this meeting,
and what's your pitch?

385
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,796
That this treaty he wants so bad
can happen.

386
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,277
He can stick it to every Pennsylvania
voter who put him out of a job...

387
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,711
...and take Mitchel's knees out before
he can put his pencils in a jar.

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,752
-Plus, who did we lose?
-He might not know.

389
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,916
He'll know.

390
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,839
-He's been out of town for a month.
-He'll know.

391
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,920
If it was anything less important
than a T est Ban Treaty--

392
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,599
Margaret!

393
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,879
Thank you.

394
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,115
-Toby.
-Messages?

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,958
-Yeah, but--
-Why are my blinds closed?

396
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,634
Yeah, listen--

397
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,874
Yeah, yeah!
That deserves an explanation.

398
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,755
Mr. Konanov? Mr. Konanov?
Yes, right in here, sir.

399
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,508
-Right in here.
-Errand boys is what they send me.

400
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,872
I am a reformer and I will lead
the Ukraine, and you know this...

401
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,272
-...and they send me errand boys.
-I'm the deputy chief of staff.

402
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,118
It's actually a very--
It's a big--

403
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,957
Never mind. Mr. Konanov,
please understand. There's protocol.

404
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,356
Your government has
a leader we deal with.

405
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,870
-You wish to deal with me.
-We do...

406
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,118
-...but right now President Shevkuh is--
-You've called my embassy?

407
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,915
We are seeking permission to have you
speak with Secretary Shaeffer--

408
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,838
I wish to speak to the president.

409
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,880
Now that's not gonna happen,
and you damn well know it.

410
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,391
-You speak to him in this tone?
-He's drunk in my office...

411
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,875
...and I will speak to him
in whatever tone pleases me.

412
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,634
Donna!

413
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,715
Put two uniformed agents outside
my door and tell Leo I'm coming over.

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,560
How I miss the Cold War.

415
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,875
-This is my fifth--
-Sam--

416
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,355
It's my last meeting on the Hill.

417
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,313
I wanna know what it'll take
to get your boss to loosen his grip.

418
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,314
If the senator moves,
he frees up eight, maybe 1 0 votes.

419
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,156
-He gives political cover to those--
-Why should he move?

420
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,950
-Well, it's the right thing to do.
-You know, Sam, it's not a holy thing.

421
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,512
You guys act like if you're against
the treaty, you're bloodthirsty.

422
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,472
Republicans aren't
the only ones against it.

423
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,030
Six secretaries of defense,
five former ClA directors.

424
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,788
A former secretary of state
and a national security advisor.

425
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,355
31 Nobel Laureates,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

426
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,918
... 1 50 countries and 82% of voters say
the treaty makes the world a safer place.

427
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,313
Not if North Korea and lran are making
significant technological improvements...

428
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,192
...while the president's
handing out pens.

429
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,954
T ell me that the chance we take...

430
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,908
...isn't outweighed by the chance
we take doing nothing.

431
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,839
-I've heard all this.
-Right, and I'm here to ask you this:

432
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,714
I'm here to ask you this:
is there no room for movement?

433
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,108
We'd consider attaching reservations.

434
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,834
If you can't trust a man's word,
what good is it to put it on paper?

435
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,997
Is there room for movement?

436
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,276
-You wasted a trip.
-I'll waste more of them.

437
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,152
-We're done?
-Yeah.

438
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,874
-Ainsley, I'm surprised to see you here.
-Why?

439
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,357
Before you were on Bartlet's payroll
you were an opponent of the treaty.

440
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,154
Well, it's President Bartlet,
I'm on the government payroll...

441
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,110
...and I believe that politics
should stop at the water's edge.

442
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,912
It should stop well before that,
but Elvis isn't cutting records anymore.

443
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,437
-What is she saying?
-I don't think you think the treaty's bad.

444
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,199
I don't think you think it's good.

445
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,672
-You just wanna beat the White House.
-Yes.

446
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,229
You're a schmuck, Peter.

447
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,909
Today, tomorrow,
next year, next term...

448
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,632
...they'll have the treaty ratified without
the reservations he just offered you.

449
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,549
Can I take this muffin?

450
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,274
Yeah.

451
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,074
-Margaret?
-Yeah.

452
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,835
-You got that memo?
-Any minute now.

453
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,752
-Margaret?
-Yeah.

454
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,838
-What the hell are you doing?
-Why, I'm typing, Leo.

455
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,233
-Margaret--
-Your response to Donna's concern...

456
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,752
...about the White House not supporting
OSHA's recommendation about RSls...

457
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,274
...was "type slower. "

458
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,156
Donna has organized most
of the assistants here to do just that.

459
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,829
-Margaret?
-Yeah.

460
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,356
Look at my face right now.

461
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,348
Okay.

462
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,195
-Leo.
-Can you keep your people in line?

463
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,238
There's been no evidence of it so far.

464
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,835
-Listen.
-lnside.

465
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,359
So, what's going on?

466
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,234
Well, I've got The Man
Who Came to Dinner in my office.

467
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,392
I'm begging the Ukrainian
Embassy for help.

468
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,270
If I don't get some soon,
I'm gonna apply for a job there.

469
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,993
No, here's what we're gonna do.

470
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,359
All this guy wants is
to be able to say he met the president.

471
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,513
-He can't meet the president.
-He can accidentally.

472
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,513
How do you do that?

473
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,916
We did it with the Dalai Lama.

474
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,431
Beijing doe'sn't want the president
to have any diplomatic contact...

475
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,632
...so they arrange a low-level meeting,
keep the door open...

476
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,879
...the president wanders by.
" Hey, how you doing, Dalai Lama? "

477
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,836
-That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
-lt works.

478
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,833
-This is how the world is run?
-Yeah.

479
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,590
-I'm sticking to domestic policy.
-Yeah, that has the ring of sanity to it.

480
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,440
-ls Toby meeting with Marino?
-Toby's on a mission.

481
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,758
I know you're not comfortable--

482
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,717
Exerting influence after being voted
out is an ethically gray area for me.

483
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,718
They' re all ethically gray areas.

484
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,514
If we'regonna have a chance,
we've gotta invite Marino.

485
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,951
-Marino's gonna want in because--
-Marino lives for revenge.

486
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,152
I was gonna say because
Marino's devoted to the issue.

487
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,919
-We may have lost one of our guys.
-Who?

488
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,992
Toby's gonna ask Marino.

489
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,953
Hey! Norma Rae, get in here.

490
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,959
The man's trying to run a country.

491
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,800
This law would prevent 32 to 95,000
injuries a year.

492
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,672
-Not here it wouldn't.
-Why not?

493
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,475
The White House and Congress are
exempt from the workplace-related laws.

494
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,432
The White House
and Congress are exempt?

495
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,832
Well, that makes things
considerably easier for yourselves.

496
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,112
-Josh, set it up.
-You've got your 4:00.

497
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,392
-I got a job for you.
-Congress and White House are exempt.

498
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,999
-Get past it.
-What do you need?

499
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,750
I need Vasily Konanov to meet with
someone of absolutely no consequence.

500
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,916
You're my girl.

501
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,191
-What the hell--?
-Meet with Vasily Konanov.

502
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,835
-Why?
-So the president can interrupt you.

503
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,951
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

504
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,195
-So I'm a beard.
-Yes.

505
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,151
-I'm being used.
-Yes.

506
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,311
-As a dupe.
-Yes.

507
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,270
-How am I supposed to feel about that?
-How do you usually feel about that?

508
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,357
-My value here is that I have no value?
-You have enormous value to me.

509
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,154
You have no value to Eastern Europe.

510
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,834
-Okay. You know what this is?
-No.

511
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,639
-This is an opportunity.
-Right.

512
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,992
This is a man who understands
the plight of the worker.

513
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,953
Or do you think he'll understand
the plight of economics?

514
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,998
He's drunk and doe'sn't speak
much English...

515
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,471
...so I don't think
he's gonna understand much.

516
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,399
But set up the meeting
and knock them dead.

517
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,878
-"Can I have this muffin? "
-Listen, I was--

518
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,438
The sharpest of closing remarks
will be blunted by asking for a muffin.

519
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,234
The minute we left, those guys
were calling their bosses saying:

520
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,870
"They' re offering reservations,
let's jump on it. "

521
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,835
You did great. And " politics stopping
at the water's edge" was touching...

522
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,315
-...and then you asked for a muffin.
-I was hungry.

523
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,876
-How'd it go on the Hill?
-As expected. But know what I think?

524
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,072
I think Ramsey, Roanoke, maybe
Grace are gonna vote for it anyway.

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,476
-Why?
-Cause T ony Marino's gonna tell them to.

526
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,194
Three senators that can't get
reelected without labor...

527
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,069
...and Marino's still gonna swing
a big bat with the unions.

528
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,834
-Toby's meeting with him now.
-Good.

529
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,833
Should I give Danny
access for a feature?

530
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,991
Yes.

531
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,595
-You're wrong.
-Okay.

532
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,438
-You should.
-Why?

533
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,995
-He's cute.
-I'm leaving.

534
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,391
-Do you have my two-page summary?
-I'm sorry?

535
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,114
-Do you have my two-page summary?
-Yes.

536
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,670
-Could I have it?
-Yes.

537
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,308
Thank you.

538
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,992
-You reversed my position.
-Yeah.

539
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,317
I gave this to you to summarize,
and you reversed my position.

540
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,192
-I polished it.
-You reversed my position.

541
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,875
-It's shorter.
-And you reversed my position.

542
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,516
-Your position was wrong.
-Could you step inside, please?

543
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,590
Senator.

544
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,996
-How you doing, Toby?
-What are you having?

545
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,919
-Dewar's rocks.
-I appreciate your coming down.

546
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,989
The president's thinking about
calling a session. You heard?

547
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,151
It was well-leaked.

548
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,915
It's nice we found a use
for our particular talents.

549
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,472
Anyway, I had a meeting at lunch
with Joe Fox and Bob Fowler...

550
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,069
...and they said we may have lost
one of our guys.

551
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,870
And I wanted to find out if it was true,
who it was and is it important.

552
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,832
It's true and it couldn't be
less important.

553
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,470
-Who is it?
-lt was me, Toby.

554
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,752
-I don't understand.
-They were talking about me.

555
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,393
I don't--

556
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,235
Tony, I don't understand.

557
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,919
You've changed your mind?
I don't--

558
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,995
No, I haven't changed my mind, and
I'll do whatever spadework you want...

559
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,430
...but if you call a session,
I can't vote for it.

560
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,676
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

561
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,553
-Tony--
-I'm a lame-duck senator.

562
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,229
The people of Pennsylvania
voted me out and Mitchel in.

563
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,837
He gets a seat on Foreign Relations,
we should all kill ourselves.

564
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,271
I'm gonna talk to Newberry about staying
where he is and stopping dominos.

565
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,949
-There's no reason why you can't--
-They voted me out.

566
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,754
Largely based on my support
of the T est Ban T reaty.

567
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,838
-Because Mitchel painted a picture.
-That's not for me to say.

568
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,430
I'm gonna choose not to assume
that my constituents were duped.

569
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,350
-Senator, nobody expects--
-Nobody expects. Nobody expects.

570
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,356
It seems we've come to expect less
from each other, and that should change.

571
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,356
I'm a senator for 1 0 more weeks.
I respect what these people want.

572
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,038
You call a lame-duck session now,
and I've got to abstain.

573
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,112
Now this is the Northwest executive
entrance to the White House.

574
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,678
Ordinarily, I'd show you more, but the
president's in the west wing right now...

575
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,236
...and when he's working, we like
to keep the area as calm as possible.

576
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,876
The whole damn world's flying apart
at the equator, you know that, Bonnie?

577
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,628
This, of course, is my boss,
Toby Ziegler.

578
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,916
Why is a T est Ban T reaty so important?

579
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,955
Let me tell you. In 1 974, lndia set off
a peaceful nuclear explosion.

580
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,879
Indira Ghandi said they had
no intention of building a bomb...

581
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,839
...just wanted to know that they could.

582
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,709
20 years later, lndia sets off
five nuclear explosions.

583
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,149
Who gets nervous? Pakistan.

584
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,670
When Pakistan gets nervous,
everybody gets nervous.

585
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,474
You know why?
Because we'reall gonna die.

586
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,996
Sam, half of America's work force
is employed by small business.

587
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,755
That's companies that employ
fewer than 100 workers.

588
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,713
-I know what it is.
-Then you know that a third of them fail.

589
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,072
One third of all small businesses
lose money and fail.

590
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,920
Not because of rent hikes
or big chains squeezing them out...

591
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,630
-... but because of why?
-Employee fraud.

592
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,319
-That's right.
-Yes.

593
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,511
-What do you say?
-You reversed my position.

594
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,997
Other than what you've been saying
for the last hour and a half.

595
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,838
I can't believe
I'm listening to a Republican...

596
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,709
...tell me the government
should run background checks.

597
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,991
I can't believe
I'm listening to a Republican.

598
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,874
Could it be that the people you want
to fingerprint have darker skin?

599
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,438
Well, not to let the facts interfere,
but 80% of violators are white.

600
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,234
Fraudulent employees are
three times more likely to be married...

601
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,156
...four times more likely to be men,
1 6 times more likely to be executives...

602
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,916
...and five times more likely
to have postgraduate degrees.

603
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,556
You-- Listen--
You know--

604
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,955
I can't--
All right.

605
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,430
-Start from the beginning.
-Really?

606
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,319
-Are you eating that donut?
-Take it and start from the beginning.

607
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,270
-Hello.
-Hey, C.J.

608
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,152
-I'm supposed to see him?
-There's a meeting...

609
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,959
...but they're circling
for a landing.

610
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,150
-You mind if I wait?
-No.

611
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,714
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Danny.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,035
-Hey, C.J.
-Hey, nimrod.

613
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,959
-I leaked your damn story for you.
-I leaked it to you, pal.

614
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,431
-I used you like so much whatever.
-Well-put.

615
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,188
-I'm here to see the president.
-He's finishing up a meeting.

616
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,116
Charlie, Danny's paper, after
savaging us four times in two weeks...

617
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,670
...would like access
to write a three-part feature.

618
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,554
-About what?
-About winning a Pulitzer Prize.

619
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,832
See, reporters seldom win
a Pulitzer. Feature writers do.

620
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,788
And The Post has been getting
a little outpaced lately.

621
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,793
Do you suspect my motives
are anything but journalistic?

622
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,152
-I'd definitely like to be part of this.
-This doe'sn't have anything to do--?

623
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,396
-C.J.
-Thank you.

624
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,830
-Good evening.
-No more rogue nations, huh?

625
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,833
-Yes, sir.
-Well, that was easy.

626
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,439
What's doing, Claudia Jean?

627
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,395
The Post would like access
for Danny to do a three-part feature.

628
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,995
Yeah, let's do it.

629
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,355
-No, I don't think it's a good idea, sir.
-Why not?

630
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,148
-After the editorials they've run--
-They've been way off base.

631
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,599
Not so much the second one, but
the first, third and fourth were silly.

632
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,950
Exactly, so let's send them a message.

633
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,993
-First of all, it wasn't Danny.
-Danny is their representative.

634
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,192
We have to stop being a punching bag
and they need a wake-up call.

635
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,999
It's gonna look petty and petulant...

636
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,472
-... because it's petty and petulant.
-Nobody elected this newspaper.

637
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,718
Certainly not the 48 million people
who chose you to be president.

638
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,549
But not having to run for anything tends
to help with honesty and decisiveness.

639
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,875
-Send Danny in.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,876
-You have to send them a message.
-I really don't, C.J.

641
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,716
-ls this personal?
-Excuse me?

642
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,355
I hear things. I don't understand it,
but I hear it.

643
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,631
No, sir, it's absolutely not personal.

644
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,956
He's a great reporter.
You're a great press secretary.

645
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,595
That's why it wasn't gonna work
as long as you had those jobs.

646
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,950
-I can assure you--
-Hey, Danny.

647
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,312
I think you guys have had your heads
up your asses the last few weeks.

648
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,875
-I hope you don't mind me saying so.
-Of course not.

649
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,994
I think you've been trying to bait me,
which is a waste of time, paper and ink.

650
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,794
I'm 50 times smarter
than any of you will ever hope to be.

651
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,593
I've got an election in two years...

652
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,195
...and I'm not about to alienate
The Washington Post.

653
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,869
I tell you what I will do.
I'm canceling our subscription.

654
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,033
Excellent, sir. The White House
buys 1 100 copies every day.

655
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,715
Canceling that subscription
should send a message.

656
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,992
No, I meant just mine and Abbey's.
I'll borrow a copy from somebody.

657
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,748
-Mr. President?
-Yeah. Take it easy, Danny.

658
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,158
C.J. will give you
all the access you want.

659
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,551
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

660
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,749
I've gotta go tell circulation
we lost $32.95.

661
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,110
I know about the job offer.

662
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,109
-I figured.
-I've known for a couple of days.

663
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,752
-Yeah.
-You don't want to be an editor?

664
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,397
-I'm a White House reporter.
-Taking a job outside the press room....

665
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,470
I have no problem with a reporter
dating the press secretary.

666
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,916
Well, I have a problem, so....

667
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,988
Yeah.

668
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,316
Okay, I'll see you later.

669
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,353
Okay.

670
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,230
The keyboard forces users to put
their wrists into a palms-down position...

671
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,432
...and encourages a sideways wrist twist
to reach the Enter key.

672
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,030
That sideways twist is called an
" ulnar deviation, " and it's very bad.

673
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,637
It has a right-hand bias toward the
important letter and number keys...

674
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,754
...and frequently used keys like Enter
and Shift are near the weakest finger...

675
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,350
-...forcing the wrist to absorb stress--
-What is this woman talking about?

676
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,835
I'm talking about my government's
unwillingness to--

677
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,311
Vasily? Vasily Konanov?

678
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,273
You're the last person I expected
to be where they told me to go.

679
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,832
-Mr. President.
-Thank you, Donna. Gentlemen.

680
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,593
-Vasily?
-Yes.

681
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,996
I don't know who this is.

682
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,471
What the hell are you doing?

683
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,919
Mr. President....

684
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,354
I would like to talk to you
about commercial lending rights.

685
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,513
I would like to talk to you about
the World Trade Organization.

686
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,753
And I would like to talk to you
about nuclear compatibility.

687
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,837
I'm not the transportation secretary...

688
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,398
...you'll join the WTO when you reduce
the 300% tariff on American cars...

689
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,114
...and with a nuclear weapon
pointed at my head...

690
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,114
... I will not talk to you
about nuclear compatibility.

691
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,919
-Mr. President--
-You're a reformer.

692
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,356
You're gonna do good things
in Eastern Europe.

693
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,915
I'm looking forward to the day
when you're president.

694
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,239
Until then, my State Department deals
with the government of the Ukraine.

695
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,232
Now you can go home and do
exactly what you wanted to do...

696
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,270
...which is say you've met with
the president of the United States.

697
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,954
You just have.

698
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,399
How you doing?

699
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,474
Yeah.

700
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,233
Yeah.

701
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,835
Thank you.

702
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,428
Dr. Zhivago is out of here.
What do you have?

703
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,995
The Commerce Department wants us
to back an amendment...

704
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,591
...to help small businesses with
fraud prevention and employee theft.

705
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,757
-We want to recommend it.
-You have numbers?

706
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,315
This is from an independent study
I have faith in.

707
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,030
30% of workers plan to steal
from their employers.

708
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,231
30% give in to occasional temptation.

709
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,988
5% will commit fraud regardless
of circumstances...

710
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,472
...85% will commit fraud
given the right circumstances.

711
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,877
-What are the right circumstances?
-Need, opportunity...

712
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,755
...and the ability to rationalize their
behavior. It's called the fraud triangle.

713
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,235
It's gonna help when
we wanna raise the minimum wage.

714
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,790
Small business owners are
opposed to wage hikes.

715
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,640
-You weren't gonna go the other way?
-Yeah, I was.

716
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,036
-You got turned around?
-Yeah.

717
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,629
-Okay, good. Thanks.
-Thanks.

718
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,150
-Hang on. I wanted to--
-Thank you, Leo.

719
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,915
-That was it?
-Yeah.

720
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,753
-That was it?
-Yeah.

721
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,190
-I don't understand.
-You don't understand what?

722
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,948
-What just happened?
-Leo said yes. We're in.

723
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,472
-I don't understand.
-Leo said yes, end of meeting.

724
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,320
I was just talking, Sam.
I was just talking to you.

725
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,279
We play with live ammo around here.

726
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,752
You convinced me, I convinced Leo.
Leo'll convince the president.

727
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,554
It's a short day and a big country.
We've gotta move fast.

728
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,833
And so because I said this in here,
the president in there is gonna...?

729
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,629
You gotta tell me
when that's gonna happen.

730
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,070
Is this how you guys
decide to go to war?

731
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,635
I don't know, I'm not in the room
when they do that.

732
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,388
Could somebody get her
a cupcake or something?

733
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,150
-Mr. President?
-Yeah.

734
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,475
-Toby's here.
-Thanks.

735
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,752
-You can take off. We're done.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

736
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,679
Good evening, sir.

737
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,234
-Tony Marino's gonna abstain, huh?
-Yeah.

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,468
He was a great public servant, Toby.
A great senator.

739
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,316
Didn't Edmund Burke say a representative
owes his industry and judgment...

740
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,917
...and betrays you if he sacrifices
his judgment to yours?

741
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,628
Yeah.

742
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,593
And then he was voted out of office
by the people of Bristol.

743
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,996
-That's not the point, sir.
-I know.

744
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,232
The fact is, the opponents of the treaty,
you gotta respect them, Toby.

745
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,671
They' re politicians flying in the face
of overwhelming public opinion.

746
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,316
I have to respect senators for defying
82% of the American people?

747
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,909
Can I tell you something honestly?

748
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,352
This is one of those situations I could
give a damn what the people think.

749
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,995
The complexities
of a global arms treaty...

750
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,479
...the technological, military, the
diplomatic nuance, it's staggering, Toby.

751
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,999
82% of the people can't possibly be
expected to reach an informed opinion.

752
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,513
-You want to call a session anyway?
-No.

753
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,551
No. If we lose, and we will...

754
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,989
-...we cut off--
-Yeah.

755
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,512
Anything else?

756
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,914
No, sir.

757
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,713
Thank you, Mr. President.

758
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,836
You know, we forget sometimes.

759
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,912
In all the talk about democracy,
we forget it's not one, it's a republic.

760
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,676
The people don't make the decisions,
they choose the people who do.

761
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,758
Could they do a better job
choosing? Yeah.

762
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,917
But when you consider
the alternatives....

763
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,760
Anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire.

764
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,951
You wanna come up for a cigar?

765
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,473
The day's over, Toby.
We'll live to fight another one.

766
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,439
-Come on up, I'll beat your ass at chess.
-You baiting me?

767
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,194
Yes.

768
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,996
Okay.

769
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,878
If anybody's out there, I'm signing off.
Have a good night.

770
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:56,878
