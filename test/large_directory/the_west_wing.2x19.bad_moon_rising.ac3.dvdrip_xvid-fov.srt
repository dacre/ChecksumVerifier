00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,435
Previously on The West Wing :

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,471
I have a relapsing-remitting
course of MS.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,558
-I'm sorry, sir?
-I have multiple sclerosis, Toby.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,149
The vice president's authority
was murky, at best.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,430
Are you pissed because
I didn't say anything...

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,473
...or because there were 1 5 people
who knew before you did?

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,989
Seven months till the caucus
and no one's been told...

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,838
...the president may
not be the nominee.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,519
-He'II run.
-He may not have that option.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,156
-You think he'II need to resign?
-There's gonna be hearing upon hearing--

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,588
He hasn't broken a Iaw.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,951
At some point in the near future
we'II have to speak to some Iawyers.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,119
-Go home.
-No.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,198
-You were up all night.
-Do you know why?

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,356
-OIiver--
-Because my staff's work...

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,829
...on the analysis of HR 437 ignored
the Fourth Amendment implications...

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,953
...and instead became fascinated
with the Third, Seventh and 1 1 th.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,914
Like you gotta be a prime number to get
the attention of the U S. Supreme Court.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,680
Get a few hours sleep
before you go to the airport.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,632
That's why I was up all night.
Where am I going?

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,671
-On vacation.
-Wait, it's coming back.

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,313
-OIiver--
-It's not a vacation.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,114
-Not a vacation. It's a forced vacation.
-In Borneo.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,393
It's an international Iaw summit where
I'm supposed to show my support for....

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm not certain. Do I have that
in my notes someplace?

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,759
-Y es.
-I need the amicus brief...

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,598
-...on sovereign immunity.
-It's there.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,358
-Federal Iand use.
-It's there.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,235
-Want us to pack your big hammer?
-Don't make fun of the big hammer.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,035
It happens to be a gavel given to my
father's father by Justice Louis Brandeis.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,958
-I need a Dictaphone.
-On your desk.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,912
-It doe'sn't work.
-What's wrong with it?

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,475
-He's asking--
-It's stuck on record. It won't stop.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,638
Just what you want Iying around
the White House counsel's office...

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,070
... because there's never been
a problem with that.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,078
-I'm putting mine in your bag.
-Okay, you know what else?

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,352
You're gonna go home and sleep
until your plane Ieaves?

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,996
I'm fine sleeping till after that. Somebody
call when the car's on the way.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,997
-Excuse me, Mr. Babish?
-I'm going home.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,318
That was Mr. McGarry's office.
He's on his way down with the president.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,231
-You should fix your tie.
-Yeah.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,032
I couldn't disagree more, Cal.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,028
As Iong as these people fund their public
school districts with property taxes...

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,516
... neither the value of the schools
nor their property will go up.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,757
It's a vicious circle.
It's terrible, and it has to be stopped.

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,633
-So we'II do something about it?
-I wouldn't go that far.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,909
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,348
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,994
-Mr. President?
-It's a vicious circle, Leo.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,553
-Never stops.
-Sir--

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,318
-Just goes round and round.
-Look--

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,670
-Round and round.
-Let's go see him.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,950
-Now?
-He's waiting for us.

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,993
-We really need to see him now?
-What better time?

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,717
-Well, Iater.
-Let's go.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,668
Five White House counsels
in two and a half years.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,158
Cochran, Gates, Solomon, T ribbey. Why
can't I keep a head Iawyer around here?

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,512
They all think they'II be counselor to
the president and you never Iet them in.

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,395
-I don't Iike new people.
-OIiver Babish isn't a new person.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,068
You know each other.
Your kids know each other.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,872
You built hospitals together.

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,514
He was Midwest finance chairman
on the campaign.

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,233
-Never played chess, though.
-No.

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,395
See?

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,477
-You're scared of Babish.
-Like you' re not.

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,194
No, because we are both men
of Chicago.

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,072
What is it with people
from Chicago...

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,595
...that they' re so happy to
have been born there?

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,439
So many people can't wait
to tell me they' re from Chicago...

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,949
...and when I meet them,
they Iive anywhere but Chicago.

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,754
-You wouldn't understand.
-He Iooks down his nose at me...

72
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,552
-... because I'm not a Iawyer.
-Y es.

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,593
I didn't go to Iaw school.
I got a Ph. D. in economics instead.

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,028
Your parents were proud.

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,789
Y eah, and all that happened was, I won
a Nobel Prize and got elected president.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,230
So I guess that decision
didn't really pay off.

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,512
-Should I get my Nobel Prize?
-I think he knows you've got one.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,075
Guy's been here three months,
he's got a nicer office than I do.

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,556
-He's got a nicer office than I do.
-That matters Iess to me.

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,751
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Hey, OIiver.

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,916
Come on in.

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,755
-What are the bags for?
-I was just heading out on vacation.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,828
-Oh, gosh, OIiver, this--
-Sir--

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,439
-This can keep.
-Mr. President--

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,392
His bags are packed.
Where are you going?

86
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,637
-Sarawak.
-Asia's best kept secret.

87
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,116
-Sir, is there something you'd Iike to...?
-It's really not even--

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,311
I don't want you to worry
that much about it.

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,397
-I'm easing in.
-Okay.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,956
Well, OIiver, it really boils down to this.
I'm gonna tell you a story...

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,799
...then I need you to tell me
if I've engaged 1 6 people...

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,719
...in a massive criminal conspiracy
to defraud the public...

93
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,878
...in order to win a presidential election.

94
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,119
Okay.

95
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,437
I'm on my way to the meeting
right now.

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,711
Finance, foreign relations,
Senate banking, I guess.

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,436
Leo's in a meeting. Someone's
gonna call you every half-hour.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,750
-Mexico collapsed?
-Y eah, can you believe it?

99
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,032
-Mexico collapsed over the weekend?
-No, actually just this morning.

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,992
How doe's a country collapse
on Monday morning?

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,839
By not slowly devaluing the peso
the way I told them to.

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,350
-You told them to devalue the peso?
-The treasury secretary did.

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,232
-Seriously--
-They' re in big trouble.

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,034
Three weeks ago, they fell
to 20 cents against the dollar.

105
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,710
Two weeks ago, the Bolsa Index
took its worst single-day fall in history.

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,196
This morning, the Mexican market
opened 20 percent off the Friday close.

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,437
-What's that in U.S. terms?
-Like a 2000 point drop in the Dow.

108
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,471
-The immediate problem--
-You saw this?

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,148
-Two hours ago. Where've you been?
-I just got here.

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,113
-We could be screwed on vouchers.
-We are screwed on vouchers, but--

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,788
-T alk to C.J.
-Somebody's gonna eat this quote.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,150
-He's pissed.
-I can't worry about it right now.

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,272
-What's the immediate problem?
-Mexico's got $30 billion worth...

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,552
...of foreign Ioans due this week,
and they don't have $30 billion.

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,079
So, what happens now?

116
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,795
Buenos días, señores y señoras.
Let's find some money.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,549
I've seen it, obviously. I just haven't
spoken to the president about it.

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,514
C.J., what may have turned the president
around on school vouchers?

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,836
-He hasn't turned around.
-Is the House--?

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,793
Sorry. The quote from the senior
White House official...

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,831
...says the president
is willing to compromise--

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,600
It sounds Iike the senior official
is willing to compromise...

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,870
... but I haven't spoken
to the president yet.

124
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,991
If I can move off the quote
for a moment.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,988
From the Coast Guard Marine Safety
and Environmental Protection Division.

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,399
Three hours ago, a single hull VLCC
carrying 4 million gallons of crude oil...

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,672
... ran up on a shoal three miles south
of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,279
-C.J.!
-C.J.!

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,074
I don't have much.
I'II give you everything I've got.

130
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,317
The hull was punctured
and the tanker is Ieaking oil.

131
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,273
-How many gallons do you think--?
-200,000 gallons so far.

132
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,994
The Coast Guard has set up
a command center with EPA workers...

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,997
...and the state emergency
response team.

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,112
- The ship belongs to Kensington Oil.
-Doe's the ship have a name?

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,472
Yeah, it's the Indio. I-N-D-I-O.
The Kensington Indio.

136
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,069
-Operations are already underway--
-Containment booms?

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,714
The Coast Guard has deployed
containment booms around the vessel.

138
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,672
- They're siphoning oil--
-What happened?

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,915
-What?
-The oil tanker.

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,553
I'm hearing it now.

141
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,957
-What do you know about the oil tanker?
-It hit Delaware.

142
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,434
I'm amazed it found Delaware.

143
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,234
The federal on-scene coordinator's
scheduled a press conference...

144
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,477
...for 2 this afternoon from the Coast
Guard Incident Command Post.

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,716
We hope to have more
information by then.

146
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,629
-C.J.!
-Thank you, everybody. Take it over.

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,875
-What the hell, C.J.?
-Anything good in the paper?

148
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,469
-Who's the senior White House official?
-I don't know.

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,070
You're telling me a reporter can just
pick up the phone and call anyone?

150
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,032
-Why?
-Because we don't Iive in T ripoli.

151
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,515
The Republican Ieaders--
Shallick, Ann Stark...

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,439
...think they can get the votes
on a compromise measure.

153
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,155
AII they were scared of was a veto.
They' re gonna build it now.

154
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,398
Our phones are gonna be ringing
with Democrats who want us dead.

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,114
Seth Gillette is gonna--
This time he's gonna be right.

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,710
Toby, I'II talk to Leo, Josh
and the president. I'II get a clarification.

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,114
What do you want me to do?

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,276
Find out who the senior
White House official was...

159
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,199
...and put his ass in my office
by the end of the day!

160
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,914
It wasn't me.

161
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,272
If it was anyone within the sound of his
voice, they'd be Iooking for a trap door.

162
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,675
Anything you can tell me
about the tanker?

163
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,472
Carol's gonna give you the notes.

164
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,830
Something to do
with the navigation or steering?

165
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,396
That's being investigated. I'm assuming
when a ship runs into the shore...

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,433
...it has something to do with either
the navigation or the steering.

167
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,832
Hey, Sam, you don't know
who it was, right?

168
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,111
No.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,430
What can you tell me about this disease
that I don't already know?

170
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,108
Not as much as a doctor.
You should talk to a doctor.

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,471
Well, I'm gonna talk to quite a few
of them, but Iet me ask you this:

172
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,353
Is it possible for someone
with relapsing-remitting MS...

173
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,553
...to experience an attack that would
include temporary Ioss...

174
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,514
...of proper brain function,
but exclude any physical symptoms?

175
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,995
Let me put it another way.

176
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,829
Is it possible that you can sit here and
have an attack, and I don't know it?

177
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,271
I think what you' re asking is,
is it possible I could...

178
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,155
... be sitting in the Situation Room,
have an attack, and nobody knows it?

179
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,158
-Y es.
-Y es.

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,510
My vision might get blurry,
you wouldn't know.

181
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,314
-My Iegs might get numb.
-Okay, sir.

182
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,478
There's something that I want
to make sure is absolutely clear.

183
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,635
What's that?

184
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,276
You and I don't enjoy
attorney-client privilege.

185
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,674
What's he talking about?

186
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,553
He's a government Iawyer.
The privilege doe'sn't exist.

187
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,672
You want to be very careful
about what you say in this room...

188
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,952
... because if subpoenaed to give
a deposition, I won't Iie under oath.

189
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,754
I don't want to be careful
about what I say in this room.

190
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,838
We should end this meeting.
You should retain private counsel.

191
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,033
I want you.
I meant, I don't need to be careful.

192
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,631
Okay.

193
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,598
I'd Iike to ask you
some questions.

194
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,076
These are preliminary, with no
preparation and in no particular order.

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,109
-Have you ever been party to a Iawsuit?
-Have I ever been party to a Iawsuit?

196
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,072
-Y es.
-I was governor of New Hampshire--

197
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,033
I mean a Iawsuit
in which you gave a deposition.

198
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,319
A meter reader slipped on a patch
of black ice in my driveway...

199
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,432
...and I got dragged into some thing
over my great aunt's will.

200
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,710
And you gave a deposition
in both those cases?

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,875
Y eah.

202
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,392
Do you recall any time in the depositions
when you were asked about your health?

203
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,434
OIiver, why are we talking about my
great aunt's will and the meter reader?

204
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,838
If you were asked about your health and
Iied in a deposition, that's the ball game.

205
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,792
We're all going home.

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,513
-He never Iied.
-I'd Iike to hear the president say that.

207
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,319
I never Iied.

208
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,029
Never had to testify under oath
about your health?

209
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,879
Never any interrogatories
or depositions about your health?

210
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,957
No.

211
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,671
Okay.

212
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,434
The first Iady and your kids, that's four.

213
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,156
The six original doctors and radiologists,
that's 1 0. Your brother, that's 1 1.

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,432
Fitzwallace, the vice president
and Leo, that's 1 4.

215
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,393
And the anesthesiologist at GW.

216
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,511
-Who's the Iast one?
-I'm sorry?

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,473
-You said 1 6 people. Who's the Iast one?
-Toby Ziegler.

218
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,795
-You told him?
-Y eah.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,878
-When?
-This past Friday night.

220
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,429
-How's he taking it?
-Not well.

221
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,396
I wouldn't think so.

222
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,831
Mr. President, I have some more
questions. Is there time now?

223
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,670
The Mexican economy crashed, an oil
tanker busted up 1 20 miles from here...

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,394
...and 1 3% of Americans
are Iiving in poverty...

225
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,516
...so, yeah. I can hang out with you and
answer insulting questions for a while.

226
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,790
Good.

227
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,034
T reasury's getting it into Iegislative
Ianguage right now.

228
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,435
The assistant secretary
for Legislative Affairs--

229
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,834
Carol Villenuevo?

230
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,553
She'II have it for us in an hour.

231
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,115
The president will call you
and ask to fast-track it.

232
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,992
He wants you to take it
to markup and vote.

233
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,270
My members are gonna need
a day to read it.

234
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,993
We understand,
but we don't have a day.

235
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,432
The very next story in the news has
gotta be the U S. guaranteeing the Ioans.

236
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,116
T reasury secretary's gotta make that
announcement when the markets open.

237
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,038
We need a vote tonight.

238
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,595
Y eah, Iisten,
the next story in the news cycle...

239
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,473
... has gotta be that the U S.
is guaranteeing the Ioans.

240
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,159
These guys just said that.

241
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,954
We may not have anything ready
till 2, 3 in the morning.

242
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,230
The president doe'sn't mind
staying up Iate to sign his name.

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,431
You also understand
no one here said yes yet.

244
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,871
-I noticed that.
-AII right....

245
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,637
-You mind if we use the room to talk?
-No. You mind talking fast?

246
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,879
-I do it for a Iiving.
-Shout to somebody if you need coffee.

247
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,597
-How's it going?
-The number of people...

248
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,712
...whose permission I need
before I can do whatever I want--

249
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,593
Let me tell you,
there's a Iot to be said for fascism.

250
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,358
-Funny you mention that.
-Toby?

251
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,039
-He wants me to find the Ieak.
-You should.

252
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,753
-No problem. Was it you?
-No.

253
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,075
Okay, now I'm stumped.

254
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,918
When there's a Ieak,
I do what I do.

255
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,634
Finding the person is impossible
under benign circumstances...

256
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,558
... but with Toby blasting around
the halls, whoever it was...

257
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,752
... has gone so far underground
we can start our search in Beijing.

258
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,793
-What about asking Cashin?
-Cashin won't roll over on a source.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,958
Then you get a swinging Iight bulb
in there and just do it.

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,116
This from the guy who had
four kinds of aneurysms...

261
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,072
...when he had to interrogate
the staff on drug use.

262
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,633
-That was different.
-Because it was you?

263
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,037
No, because that was an investigation
into personal behavior.

264
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,754
-This guy compromised a policy initiative.
-Fair point.

265
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm not saying it's not bad.
I'm saying I won't find him.

266
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,553
-You're absolutely not gonna find him.
-I should do it anyway?

267
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,034
-Y es.
-Because Toby's pissed?

268
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,834
Hey, you know what?
I found that if you accept that...

269
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,429
...as a good enough reason,
Iife becomes easier.

270
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,915
-Thanks for the fortune-cookie wisdom.
-You bet.

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,838
Josh?

272
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,112
-You just Iurk there in the shadows, Iike--
-Whatever.

273
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,311
-What are you doing?
-Things with paper.

274
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,555
-Do them Iater.
-Why?

275
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,514
-So you' re not doing them now.
-I had a couple of questions.

276
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,678
-About what?
-The Mexico bailout.

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,075
-Can you ask Iater?
-Later it might be a done deal.

278
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,592
Before you send $30 billion of my money
to Mexico, I wanna ask a few questions.

279
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,234
-It's gonna be one of these now, right?
-Y eah.

280
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,317
-You object to the bailout?
-I do.

281
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,353
In the world of Donnatella Moss,
we should all Iove one another.

282
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,312
As Iong as
it doe'sn't cost you anything.

283
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,909
Well, yes. That's one
small-minded way of putting it.

284
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,429
CIose the door.

285
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,549
Donna?

286
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,998
-With me on the other side?
-Thank you.

287
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,838
-Hey.
-How you doing?

288
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,429
-Is he back yet?
-No.

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,914
You decided yet?

290
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,714
Theology 201 :
Intro to Biblical Literature.

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,911
-Why?
-So the president'II stop bugging me.

292
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,958
And English 201 :
T exts and Contexts.

293
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,197
-What happened to molecular biology?
-It's closed out for summer.

294
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,197
How many high school
AP credits do you have?

295
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,709
I have six in English,
six in math and calculus...

296
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,115
...three in European history
and three in French.

297
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,833
You've never been to college...

298
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,430
...and after taking two classes this
summer, you' re gonna be a junior?

299
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,632
-With a pretty decent GPA.
-Charlie, just how smart are you?

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,878
-I've got some game.
-Sam?

301
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,475
-She's here?
-Y eah.

302
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,069
Thanks. Excuse me.

303
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,712
-Lieutenant?
-Mr. Seaborn?

304
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,069
-Sam.
-Emily.

305
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,918
You Iook exactly the way
you sound on the phone.

306
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,951
You Iook exactly the way
you Iook on the news.

307
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,639
-Thanks for coming.
-No problem.

308
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,515
I'm surprised to see you in dress uniform
on a day Iike you must be having today.

309
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,757
We're required to wear the CIass A's for
business on the Hill or the White House.

310
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,791
-I never knew.
-Never noticed that every soldier...

311
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
...and sailor to walk in here
has been in a dress uniform?

312
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,990
I'm Iess observant than others,
but I make up for it.

313
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,792
-How?
-With cunning and guile.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,877
Okay.

315
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,914
What happened to the ship?

316
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,669
It suffered some kind of malfunction,
causing steering Ioss 1 0 miles offshore.

317
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,314
The captain dropped anchor
to avoid a run-in with marine traffic.

318
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,875
If he dropped anchor 1 0 miles out,
why's it here?

319
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,513
-The anchor broke.
-The anchor broke?

320
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,790
-Anchors break?
-I want you to guess something.

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,356
A ship of the size and gross tonnage
of the Indio, steaming at 1 8 knots...

322
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,393
... how Iong doe's it take to come
to a complete stop from the moment...

323
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,478
...the bridge cuts the engines
and throws the props into reverse?

324
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,910
I don't know.
A couple of football fields.

325
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,156
-Six miles.
-Six miles.

326
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,157
There's no anchor that stops it
at 1 8 knots.

327
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,430
-So it's drifting--
-Which is when we got...

328
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,108
...a dead-in-the-water mayday
and sent the Tallahassee to tow it in.

329
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,275
What happened to that?

330
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,119
25-foot seas,
wind out of the north-northeast at 40.

331
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,470
-So it made for port.
-With every intention of going back--

332
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,272
-But the wind--
-And the tidal pull--

333
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,550
Pushed the Indio into shore.

334
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,350
-How bad is this gonna end up being?
-Bad.

335
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,677
Everyone's in it. Coast Guard,
EPA, NTSB, state, Iocal...

336
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,237
... but there are only so many pairs
of hands and getting oil out of water...

337
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,078
...you try it sometime.

338
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,958
Listen, thanks again for coming by.

339
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
-Want me to keep you posted?
-I'd appreciate it.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,355
-Good Iuck.
-Thanks.

341
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,876
-Do you have Iife insurance?
-No.

342
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,196
A wife and three kids,
and no Iife insurance?

343
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,393
I have accidental death insurance
as well as considerable personal worth.

344
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,831
Were I to die, my family would
not miss my government salary.

345
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,395
-Health insurance?
-I don't have any anymore.

346
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,558
-Why not?
-I'm the husband of a doctor...

347
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,435
...and as a governor and president, the
various governments I've Ied generously--

348
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,712
Let me cut to the end of the page.
Have you ever signed any document...

349
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,639
...for health insurance or Iife insurance
or any document...

350
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,718
...which falls under the pains and penalty
of perjury in which you were asked...

351
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,559
...about your health and did not
disclose you have MS?

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,194
No.

353
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,633
You should probably make the call.

354
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,078
Y eah. Excuse me.

355
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,991
What do you think?

356
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,919
I am nowhere close to being able
to answer that question.

357
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,115
C.J., you wanted
to see Jamie Hotchkiss?

358
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,833
No. But yes.

359
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,195
-Hey, Jamie, how you doing?
-I'm pissed about the quote this morning.

360
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,958
I know how you feel.

361
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,676
My team's been working for nine months.
Can't get Ieverage with rubber crowbars.

362
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,359
-They' re gonna jump on this.
-Y es.

363
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,233
-I'd Iike to ask you some questions.
-Sure.

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,399
The vouchers meeting in the Roosevelt
Room Iast Thursday, were you part of it?

365
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,591
I've been in on those meetings
from the beginning.

366
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,794
Right. Have you talked to T erry Cashin of
the Baltimore Sun in the Iast four days?

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,468
-What?
-I was wondering if in the Iast four days--

368
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,148
You're asking me if I'm the Ieak?

369
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,476
-I was gonna be more circumspect.
-I can tell.

370
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,432
I've been working on this
for nine months.

371
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,757
Frankly, and I don't say this
to you enough, doing a very good job.

372
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,837
-Thank you.
-Do you know who the Ieak is?

373
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,076
Listen up.
I'm not the Ieak.

374
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,953
I don't know who the Ieak is.
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

375
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,311
-Any other questions?
-No. We wrapped that up tight.

376
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,710
Thank you.

377
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,033
-Carol?
-Y eah.

378
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,234
-How many more of these do I have?
-1 1 38.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,150
Okay. After five of them,
I'm gonna confess.

380
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,397
-You ready for the next one?
-Sure.

381
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,229
-They' re not done meeting yet?
-In the Roosevelt Room?

382
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,032
-No.
-Okay.

383
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,151
-You got a phone message.
-From who?

384
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,476
-Frank Kelly.
-Who's he?

385
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,750
He's a textiles worker
in South Carolina...

386
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,077
... making $ 1 2. 1 7 an hour
with no health insurance.

387
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,555
His two kids go to public school.
The school's fine...

388
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,796
... but they've had to cut art
and music for budget...

389
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,956
...and Frank's 1 0-year-old
is nuts about the trumpet.

390
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,311
The mom doe's telemarketing at night
after the kids have gone to bed...

391
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,953
...to pay for Iessons
and rent an instrument.

392
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,994
Not that art and music are important,
or that any of us had any fun doing it.

393
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,873
Frank obeys the Iaw, pays his bills.
He also pays his taxes.

394
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,232
And he called to thank you
for sending his money to Mexico.

395
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,237
-Doe's he want me to call back?
-Josh--

396
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,829
Why don't you call him back
and remind him...

397
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,669
...that the Mexican consumers who buy
his textiles can't afford to buy them.

398
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,394
Frank will be Iaid off,
which isn't a problem.

399
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,990
There are plenty of jobs out there
for a 48-year-old textiles worker...

400
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,431
...as Iong as he's trained in high-tech
computers or medical research.

401
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,598
Like the 30 billion makes it
into the pockets of Mexican consumers.

402
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,950
Eventually it doe's.
We're not giving them the money.

403
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,197
We're giving them our credit card
and paying the bill. It's a Ioan.

404
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,119
We did the same thing six years ago.
The Ioan was paid back.

405
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,709
We did the same thing
four years before that, right?

406
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,875
-Yes.
-Five years before?

407
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,672
-Y es.
-AA's definition of insanity...

408
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,519
...is doing the same thing again and
again, expecting a different result.

409
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,713
I'm not cheap. Nor am I xenophobic.
I just think it's time for some tough Iove.

410
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,232
Well, not right here, but if you want
to run home and get your equipment--

411
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,475
Go away from me.

412
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,434
The telemarketing was a nice detail,
but you should've said "scrubbed floors. "

413
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,758
-I thought it'd be too much.
-Y eah, probably.

414
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,359
Come in.

415
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,831
-Hey.
-Hello, Sam.

416
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,349
-You did some decorating.
-Yeah.

417
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,393
-A woman's touch.
-It was a guy named Kirk.

418
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,556
I know this piece of music.
I Iove it.

419
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,513
-Isn't it great?
-No, but there's a reason I Iike it.

420
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,632
-Well, it's beautiful.
-But there's another reason. Hang on.

421
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,149
It's called "Air on a 'G' String. "
Could that be--?

422
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,839
Yes. Thank you.

423
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,759
-What do you need?
-A Iawyer.

424
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,997
-Well, you came to the wrong place.
-Seriously.

425
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,198
-Are you in trouble?
-No. I'm not.

426
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,436
I just want to ask you
some questions.

427
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,150
You've been covering the attorneys
general for Maryland and Delaware?

428
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,873
-On the oil spill?
-Y eah.

429
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,072
They'II hold a press conference
to announce they' re seeking damages.

430
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,077
-How much?
-Who can say at this point...

431
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,875
... but if I had to guess, I'd say in the
area of 100 million for cleanup costs.

432
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,832
Probably another 3
or 400 million punitive.

433
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,998
I know how you feel about this.
Kensington will pay through the nose.

434
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,679
-They' re not.
-I think you' re wrong.

435
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,996
Somebody's gonna pay.
It's not gonna be them.

436
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,395
-Think their Iiability shield is that strong?
-I do.

437
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,715
How do you know?

438
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,150
Because I'm the one
who bought them the boat.

439
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,635
I bought the Indio for them
when I was at Gage Whitney.

440
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,592
Wow.

441
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,310
T alk about your chickens
coming home to roost.

442
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,308
Yeah, but what I was thinking was this--
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

443
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,432
... but I was thinking,
if I could be deposed for the plaintiffs.

444
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,949
-Why?
-Because....

445
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,232
Look, I was very proud of myself
for making such a great deal.

446
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,910
It sealed it for me with the partners,
and they were about to make me one.

447
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,715
And it really didn't bother me
that the boat was cheap for a reason.

448
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,831
At the 1 1 th hour,
I had a change of heart.

449
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,031
For whatever reason,
I had a change of heart.

450
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,631
I told them the boat wasn't good enough,
particularly the steering and navigation.

451
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,991
Which they already knew, and
I suggested they spend more money--

452
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,111
-Stop talking.
-1 1 million extra dollars.

453
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,438
-They Iaughed me out of the room.
-Stop talking, or I'm walking out.

454
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,036
You know better.

455
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,028
Neither you nor your clients abdicated
attorney-client privilege when you Ieft.

456
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,196
If you gave that deposition,
you'd be disbarred.

457
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,868
Even if you were willing
to be disbarred...

458
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,470
...there's no judge in the country
who'd allow privileged testimony.

459
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,672
Unless a company Iike this is forced
to fork over so much money...

460
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,714
...they don't wanna go on Iiving, unless
they' re compelled to pay $500 million...

461
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,549
...there's no incentive for them to pay
the 1 1 million to make the boat safer.

462
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,159
Yes.

463
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,436
AII right, it was just an idea.

464
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,269
Hey, you never know.
With the Iiability shield.

465
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,435
-Maybe you' re not as good as you think.
-Y eah, I am.

466
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,996
You still filling out forms, Charlie?

467
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,634
I'm gonna be filling out forms
for quite some time.

468
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,558
It's basically gonna be my major.

469
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,354
-What is gonna be your major?
-I really don't know.

470
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,199
-You gonna join the glee club?
-I don't think so.

471
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,549
GIee club's important.

472
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,230
I only have time for a couple classes
at night. I won't be able to be gleeful.

473
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,759
-How about fencing?
-Fencing?

474
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,791
-You're taking fencing?
-I'm not taking fencing.

475
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,319
Not taking glee club, either.

476
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,751
Fencing's good, because you Iearn
the philosophy of self-defense.

477
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,512
I don't get a Iot of people pulling
an épéé on me in my neighborhood.

478
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,759
My philosophy of self-defense has a Iot
to do with running as fast as I can.

479
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,474
These forms are really out of control.
Look at this:

480
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,877
Six forms for financial aid,
three forms for housing--

481
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,513
I'm not using their housing.

482
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,678
A form for roommate preference,
and I'm not using their housing.

483
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,792
Emergency contacts,
general activity information...

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,835
...transfer of credits,
and a 1 4-page form--

485
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,518
What?

486
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,757
-Charlie, what--?
-Hang on, please.

487
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,751
-Margaret, I need to speak to Leo.
-He's in a meeting with OIiver Babish.

488
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,159
Y eah, I know. I'm sorry,
I need to speak to him right now, please.

489
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,351
T ell him it's an old friend from home.

490
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,273
You sure?

491
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,959
Y eah.

492
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,155
He's acting a Iittle pissy,
wouldn't you say?

493
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,033
-You're a Iittle pissy too, my friend.
-Well, I'm pissed.

494
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,194
-No kidding.
-You weren't when you found out?

495
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,311
-I was, but then I remembered.
-What?

496
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,555
That I'm a drunk,
and he didn't give a damn.

497
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,472
-You guys gonna go public?
-I don't know.

498
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,348
-What do you think?
-Not up to me.

499
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,996
-Up to the policy advisers.
-I think you' re about to be one of them.

500
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
-I don't know if I'm staying yet.
-You're staying.

501
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,669
-Why?
-I'm running the show, and I picked you.

502
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
-I didn't bring you here for amicus briefs.
-Leo--

503
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,437
In the two hours
we've been sitting here...

504
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,029
... have you discovered one thing
that he's done wrong?

505
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,356
-No.
-So, what's your problem?

506
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,836
That's my problem, Leo.
Are you out of your mind?

507
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,837
He did everything right.

508
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,238
He did everything you do
if your intent is to perpetrate a fraud.

509
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,238
Come in.

510
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,035
Mr. McGarry, Margaret called to say
Charlie Young needs to speak with you.

511
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,958
I can't right now.
It'II have to wait.

512
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,835
She said to mention something
about an old friend from home.

513
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,389
I'II be right back.

514
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,476
What is it?

515
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,550
Charlie, you can talk to me.
What is it?

516
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,198
-Charlie--
-When Zoey and EIIie went to college....

517
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,549
When they went to college, they would
have had to fill out a health form.

518
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,199
-What are you--?
-The form asks for a number of things.

519
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,039
Including a complete
family medical history.

520
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,551
God.

521
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,028
Charlie.

522
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,113
How did you know he was sick?

523
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,754
How did you know
that the president was sick?

524
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,835
-Charlie--
-Leo...

525
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,357
...if you' re under 1 8 when you start
as a freshman....

526
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,433
If you' re under 1 8,
you need a parent's signature.

527
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,551
Okay.

528
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,639
-I'm sorry--
-It's okay--

529
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,549
-I just thought it was--
-You absolutely did the right thing.

530
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,829
Okay.

531
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,709
Okay. Go back to work.

532
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,959
Margaret.

533
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,191
I need to see all of Zoey Bartlet's
admissions paperwork for Georgetown.

534
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,072
I don't think they'II release that.

535
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,590
No, you call Pat Carr, the family Iawyer,
and you tell him I want it.

536
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,032
-Can I tell him why?
-Just get it right now, would you?

537
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,069
Josh was in the Roosevelt Room
meeting Iast Thursday?

538
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,793
-Y es.
-And do you recall him...

539
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,276
-...talking to you about what went on?
-I don't know. He might have.

540
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,789
-It's important.
-I'II try and remember.

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,195
Somebody might have overheard
you talking to him.

542
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,437
There's so much to remember.

543
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,159
-Are you okay?
-I'm just-- I'II be fine.

544
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,437
And you yourself didn't talk
to anybody, did you?

545
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,558
-Donna?
-C.J., I can't--

546
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,594
-What?
-I can't Iie Iike this anymore.

547
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,832
-Was it you?
-I feel horrible.

548
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,837
I should've said something before,
but I was afraid--

549
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,031
-It's okay.
-No, Iet me get this off my chest.

550
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,074
-It was me. I called T erry Cashin.
-Why?

551
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,748
I don't know.
Why doe's anybody do anything?

552
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,190
-What are you talking about?
-I'm a madwoman.

553
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,072
-It doe'sn't stop with the Ieak.
-What?

554
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,510
Call the authorities. Send them
to my parents' house.

555
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,948
Why?

556
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,913
They'II find the Lindbergh baby
in the basement.

557
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,951
AIso some Post-its reminding me
where I put Jimmy Hoffa.

558
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,559
-Get out!
-I framed Roger Rabbit.

559
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,079
Get out!

560
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,870
-I'm going to the place. Want a salad?
-Thanks.

561
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,674
Carol!

562
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,989
Did you confess?

563
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,760
She didn't Iet me get to Whittaker
Chambers and the secret pumpkin.

564
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,473
You got a phone call.

565
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,433
-From who?
-Europe in 1 939.

566
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,232
-Yeah?
-Y eah, I jotted it down.

567
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,715
They' re at war,
but we've taken a firm stand...

568
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,115
...as an isolationist nation
and refuse to get involved.

569
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,676
Our resources are ours. Their problems
are on the other side of the world.

570
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,632
Though they do have problems.

571
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,638
It sounds to me
that France, Austria and England...

572
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,230
...are getting absolutely pounded by
the Germans and with no end in sight.

573
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,273
They say that by 1 941,
they'II desperately need our help...

574
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,314
...if they have any chance of survival,
but I think they' re being hysterical.

575
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,308
This son of a customs agent with the
Chaplin mustache ain't going anywhere.

576
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,953
There's no telling that
to Franklin Roosevelt...

577
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,232
...who's trying to convince his country
they need to get involved.

578
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,078
That's why he came up with this.

579
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,956
-An 8th grade social studies textbook?
-T urn to the page I flagged.

580
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,191
-The Lend-Lease Act.
-Yeah.

581
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,119
Simply put, a Ioan of arms
to Russia and Britain...

582
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,709
...that they'd pay back
when the war was over.

583
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,309
And he said,
" If your neighbor's house is on fire...

584
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,795
...you don't haggle over the price
of a garden hose. "

585
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,197
Frank Kelly in South Carolina wouldn't--

586
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,838
There are too many things
in the world we can't do.

587
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,917
Mexico's on fire.

588
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,192
Why help them?
Because we can.

589
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,870
-Did they agree to the money?
-Y eah.

590
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,435
Okay.

591
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,429
You shouldn't feel bad about this.

592
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,438
-Everyone hates me.
-No. They'II get over it.

593
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,673
-You think?
-Sure, you' re just doing your job.

594
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,672
-That's exactly right.
-And this is really important.

595
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,316
You're the first one
who's understood that.

596
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,114
Mind if I give you a suggestion
that may make this go faster?

597
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,515
Sure.

598
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,712
If you dunk the suspect in a deep
well of water and they drown...

599
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,673
-...it means they' re not a witch.
-AII right, that's it.

600
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,916
I saw Lizzie Proctor
speaking with the devil!

601
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,838
Shut up!

602
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,319
720,000 gallons
covering close to 100 square miles.

603
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,590
T en thousand blue and horseshoe crabs
are dead.

604
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,590
That's a $25 million industry that can
start Iooking for jobs at the Dairy Queen.

605
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,553
"Twelve thousand five hundred starfish,
flounder and bass.

606
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,038
342 million estimated Ioss to the tourism
economy based on beach communities. "

607
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,832
You ever wonder
why you never hear...

608
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,715
...about a boatload of Honda Civics
spilling into the ocean?

609
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,669
What?

610
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,357
-Were you Iistening?
-Y eah.

611
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,390
No. I'm sorry, no.

612
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,189
-Excuse me. Sam, would you mind?
-No.

613
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,634
It's me. Okay?
I am Spartacus.

614
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,829
-Look--
-It was a Ieak.

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,713
Leaks happen. They've happened
since the beginning of time.

616
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,310
In this White House, in every White
House. There's no malicious intent.

617
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,751
Things get out. It's a company town.
Everybody talks to everybody.

618
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,316
Junior staffers try to impress reporters
by showing they' re in the know.

619
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,672
There is no group of people this Iarge
in the world that can keep a secret.

620
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,030
I find it comforting. It's how
I know for sure the government...

621
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,674
...isn't covering up aliens
in New Mexico.

622
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,475
Toby, I've issued a blanket e-mail
to 1 100 staffers about the incident.

623
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,240
I've asked the president to Iet me
make a clarification tomorrow.

624
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,476
I've seen to it it'II be on page one.

625
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,832
We're not gonna Iose an inch
of ground in the negotiation.

626
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,079
No, we'renot.

627
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,829
No, we'renot.
And you knew that since this morning.

628
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,031
Y es, I did.

629
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,080
Y eah. So, what's this about?

630
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,874
This is small potatoes.

631
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,072
I want to know, when the big potatoes
come, are we up for it?

632
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,432
Big potatoes? Toby, we ran for election,
we Iived through Leo and booze...

633
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,029
.. Sam and prostitutes,
India and Pakistan...

634
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,791
... Colombia and a failed rescue mission,
are there bigger potatoes someplace?

635
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,911
No.

636
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,678
-Toby?
-Y eah?

637
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,439
-Why are you Iying to me?
-I'm not.

638
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,074
Thanks for doing that stuff today.
It was--

639
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,917
Thanks.

640
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,431
Sit down. Don't be scared.

641
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,074
My youngest daughter's
got a big mouth.

642
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,034
No, she doe'sn't, sir.

643
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,634
She wanted me to be on the Iookout
for certain physical signs...

644
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,910
...so I could tell the first Iady.

645
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,271
We won't discuss this anymore for the
time being. It'II be public soon enough.

646
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,357
The more conversations
you have with me...

647
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,438
...the more Iawyers
you' re gonna have to talk to.

648
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,915
They bill in an hour
what you take home in a week.

649
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,157
So we won't discuss it
except to say this:

650
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,955
You're gonna be subpoenaed.
I'm confident in your Ioyalty to me.

651
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,879
I'm confident in your Iove for me.

652
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,437
If you Iie to protect me,
if you Iie just once...

653
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,599
...if you Iie just a Iittle,
if you Iie because you can't stand...

654
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,837
...what's happening to me
and the people making it happen...

655
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,909
...if you ever, ever Iie...

656
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,273
...you' re finished with me,
you understand?

657
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,790
Y es, sir.

658
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,398
Say you understand.

659
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,399
I understand, sir.

660
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,548
Go back to work.

661
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,710
Y es, sir.

662
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,069
Is there anything you need?

663
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,070
I need you to go to Iaw school and
graduate as soon as humanly possible.

664
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,510
Yes, sir.

665
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,274
-Good evening, Mr. President.
-Well, I've got good news for you.

666
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,313
T urns out I didn't do
everything right after all.

667
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,838
Zoey had to fill out a family
history form for Georgetown...

668
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,191
...and because she was 1 7,
a parent had to sign it.

669
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,032
-And she Ieft off the MS?
-Y eah.

670
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,596
-And you signed it?
-I'd give anything if I had.

671
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,678
It was Lady Macbeth.

672
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,476
There's a bad moon rising, OIiver.
We both know it.

673
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,797
They' re gonna take me out
for a walk.

674
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,869
This isn't what you signed up for.

675
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,871
Leo begged you to take this job,
and this isn't what you signed up for.

676
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,594
If you Ieave,
I'd appreciate if you did it now...

677
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,872
...so that it doe'sn't Iook Iike my Iawyer
bailed on me when the rain starts.

678
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,991
No one's gonna hold it against you.

679
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,238
Well, I appreciate that,
Mr. President.

680
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,192
If I stay, will you do
exactly what I tell you to do?

681
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,635
-I guess it depends.
-No, I'm afraid it can't depend, sir.

682
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,949
What would my first step be?

683
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,196
First, tell your staff.

684
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,232
Then decide how to make
a public announcement.

685
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,551
Then order the attorney general
to appoint a special prosecutor.

686
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,478
Not just any special prosecutor.

687
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,229
The most blood-spitting, Bartlet-hating
Republican in the bar.

688
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,318
He's gonna have an unlimited budget
and a staff Iike an army.

689
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,592
The new slogan around here
is gonna be " Bring it on. "

690
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,913
He'II have access to every piece
of paper you ever touched.

691
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,749
If you invoke executive privilege
one time, I'm gone.

692
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,589
An assistant DA in Ducksworth wants
to take your deposition, you' re there.

693
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,031
A freshman congressman wants
your testimony, you'II sit in his kitchen.

694
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,959
They wanna drag you to The Hague and
charge you with war crimes...

695
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,388
...what do we say?

696
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,951
Bring it on.

697
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,830
I'II be in my office for a while
if you need me.

698
